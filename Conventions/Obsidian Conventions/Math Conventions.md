# Math Conventions

- For when variables/constants are used, instead of having multiple variables/constants, like $x, y, z, a, b, c$, and so on, use subscripts instead since for notes that need multiple variables/constants, might run out of them. Only do this for variables/constants with similar purpose. Different variable/constant letters could be used (with their own subscripts if needed) for other variables/constants (e.g., for a general function, could have the inputs be $x_1, x_2, ...$, while the outputs be $y_1, y_2, ...$).
- For LaTeX math inside callouts (i.e., definitions, theorems, proofs, examples, etc...), always use display mode (i.e., double $) with *align* block. The double $ and the *align* block boundaries (i.e., begin align and end align) are each on their own line. As for the math itself, the first two math portions separated by a logical relation are on the same line, while every next one will be on a new line. The spacing is set on the logical relation with & symbol. For an example, see the [[Addition Property of Equality]] note. For spacing parts of math on the same line (e.g., logical quantifiers), use quad.
