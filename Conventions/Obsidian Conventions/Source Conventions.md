# Source Conventions

- Cite all of your sources using footnotes. Footnotes are placed directly after the end of a sentence/phrase/structure without any spaces. Sources at the bottom should provide a link to the material so that one could easily go to and check where the information came from.

TODO:
- Link to a note which demonstrates these conventions
