# Highlight Conventions

- Use ***Highlight Text*** when dealing with text-based parts.
- Use ***Add Note*** when wanting to add comments without any highlights.
- Use ***Select Area*** when dealing with parts that cannot be easily or clearly highlighted, such as graphs, images, certain tables, and etc...
- Added personal comments in Zotero can be thought of as the raw and unfiltered fleeting and/or literature notes within the [[Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] system, which will then be processed into permanent notes within Obsidian.

* Each annotation should represent one idea. If there is more than one idea in an annotation, separate it. 
	* For example, if there are two sentences, where the first is about Commutative Property, while the second is about Distributive property, the first annotation should be about Commutative Property, while the second should be about Distributive Property rather than one two-sentence-long annotation.
