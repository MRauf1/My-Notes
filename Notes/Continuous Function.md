# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Continuous [[Function]])[^1]
> [[Function]] $f$ is continuous at $a$ if
> 1) $f(a)$ is defined ($a$ is in the [[Domain]] of $f$)
> 2) $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$ exists
> 3) $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)$

If a function is continuous at $a$, then the [[Limit of Function Direct Substitution Property]] can be applied to the function.

If a function is continuous at every point of its domain, then the graph of the function has no gaps.
