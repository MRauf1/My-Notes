# Review

Short, but dense book about [[Vipassana Meditation]]. The book talks about various aspects of the meditation, such as its benefits, how to perform it, warnings to keep in mind, and more. It is a very detailed piece of text with a dense and helpful amount of information.

In addition to the meditation itself, it also naturally provides some interesting insights from [[Buddhism]], some of which are [[Philosophy|philosophical]] in nature.

Overall, it is a great introduction to Vipassana meditation, and I'd recommend it to others as a book to get started with meditation.
