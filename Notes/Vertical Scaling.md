> For a [[Function|function]] $f$ and $k \in \mathbb{R}^+$, the function $kf(x)$ [[Multiplication|multiplies]] all the $y$-coordinates of the [[Point|points]] of $f(x)$ by $k$[^1]
> - $k > 1 \implies$ the [[Graph|graph]] of $f$ is vertically stretched by a factor of $k$
> - $0 < k < 1 \implies$ the graph of $f$ is vertically shrunk by a factor of $\frac{1}{k}$

Multiplying the outputs of $f$ vertically scales the graph by a factor of $k$.
