# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Least Common Multiple)
> Least common multiple of two [[Integer|integers]] $a, b$, denoted as $lcm(a, b)$, is a [[Natural Number]] $d$ such that
> 1) $a|d \land b|d$
> 2) $n \in \mathbb{Z}, a|n \land b|n \implies d|n$

Least common multiple (LCM) is the smallest [[Common Multiple|common multiple]] of two [[Number|numbers]].[^1]

It is guaranteed to exist and is unique.

It can be found using the [[Prime Factors Method|prime factors method]]. Alternatively, it can be found by finding progressively larger [[Multiple|multiples]] of the larger number and see if the multiple number is [[Divisible|divisible]] by the lower number. 

# Properties

- $a, b \in \mathbb{N}, d = gcd(a, b), m = lcm(a, b) \implies m = \frac{ab}{d}$

#TODO 
- For first property, what about integers
