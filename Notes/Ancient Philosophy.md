# Definition

[[Philosophy]] during the [[Ancient Era]].

The earliest philosophers were known as sages and stood out from others in that they used reason to learn more about the natural world.

According to some, philosophy requires the same type of abstract thought as the one for bureaucratic administration of society. Philosophical traditions may have developed as a result.[^1]
