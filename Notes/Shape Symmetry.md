# Definition

[[Symmetry|Symmetries]], or geometrical operations that create symmetries can be composed. The table of all possible compositions forms a multiplication table.

Symmetries form a [[Group|group]].

Rotations can be described with [[Matrix|matrices]], and thus, the composition of rotations can then be described by [[Matrix Multiplication|matrix multiplication]].

# Types

## [[Rectangle|Rectangle]]

### Symmetries

Rectangle has $4$ symmetries[^1]

1) [[Identity Property|Identity]] (Non-motion)
2) [[Rotation|Rotation]] around $x$-[[Axis|axis]] by $\pi$ radians
3) [[Rotation|Rotation]] around $y$-[[Axis|axis]] by $\pi$ radians
4) [[Rotation|Rotation]] around $z$-[[Axis|axis]] by $\pi$ radians

#TODO 
- Non-abelian group, not just group -> not commutative
