# Definition

Type of [[Deontology]] formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]].[^1]

Just like deontology, take action according to one's duties and rules.

Humans all have inherent value, and as such, must never be treated as a means to an end. They are the end itself.

Unlike [[Utilitarianism]], what matters is one's intention, not the result.

# Imperatives
- [[Hypothetical Imperative]]
- [[Categorical Imperative]]
