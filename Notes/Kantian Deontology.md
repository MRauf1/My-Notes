# Definition

Type of [[Deontology]] formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]].[^1]

Just like deontology, take action according to one's duties and rules.

Humans all have inherent value, and as such, must never be treated as a means to an end. They are the end itself.

Unlike [[Utilitarianism]], what matters is one's intention, not the result.

Take actions for the sake of your moral duty. When in doubt, ask whether the maxim (principle of action) can be made into a universal law. If yes, then take it, otherwise, don't.

# Imperatives
- [[Hypothetical Imperative]]
- [[Categorical Imperative]]
