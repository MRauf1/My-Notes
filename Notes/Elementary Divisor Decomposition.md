# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Elementary Divisor Decomposition)
> A finite [[Abelian Group]] $G$ is [[Group Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[Group]] of the following form
> $$
> \begin{align}
> G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_k^{r_k}}
> \end{align}
> $$
> where $k \geq 0, r_1 \geq 1$, $p_i$ are [[Prime Number|prime numbers]].
> $p_1^{r_1}, \dots, p_k^{r_k}$ are the elementary divisors.
> For a given $G$, the elementary divisors are unique, up to reordering.

# Properties

## Converting To/From [[Invariant Factor Decomposition]]

## Existence/Uniqueness Proof
It's quite involved. Refer to the Abstract Algebra lecture notes.
