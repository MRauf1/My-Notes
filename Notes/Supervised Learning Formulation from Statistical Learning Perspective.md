# Definition

In [[Statistical Learning]], given input $X$ and true output $Y$, we assume there is a relationship between the two written in general as $Y = f(X) + \epsilon$ where $f$ is some fixed but unknown [[Function]] of $X$ and $\epsilon$ is the random error term, which is [[Independent Random Variable]] of $X$ and has a [[Mean]] of $0$.[^1]

# Why Estimate $f$
- [[Prediction]]
- [[Inference]]

#TODO 
Does the error have to be normally distributed?
