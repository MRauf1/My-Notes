# Review[^1]

Textbook on [[Psychology]] by [[OpenStax]].

Relatively long sitting at about 650 pages worth of content covering the foundational topics of psychology.

I enjoyed the beginning-mid and end chapters of the textbook.

The material is very introductory, but is backed with plethora of citations. A good material for starting exploration of psychology.

Rather than reading the full book, I recommend going only through the chapters that interest you.
