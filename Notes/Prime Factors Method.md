# Definition

1. Find the [[Prime Factorization|prime factorizations]] of each of the two [[Number|numbers]].
2. [[Least Common Multiple|LCM]] is the [[Multiplication|product]] of the following two parts.
	1. Take the product of matching [[Prime Number|primes]] (i.e., primes that appear in both prime factorizations). Each pair of matching primes is counted only once (e.g., if $2$ appears in both, multiply the current product by $2$, not by $2 \cdot 2$).
	2. Take the product of non-matching primes.
