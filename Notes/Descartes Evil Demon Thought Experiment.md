# Definition

Assume an evil demon is tricking all of our sensations/experiences with false ones. In such a case, what can we be sure of?

The following can't both be true:
1) I think that I exist.
2) I am wrong about whether I do.
Since if we're thinking that we exist, then we are thinking, which is possible only if we exist. This leads to the famous "I think, therefore I am".

# Problems
Some argue that the conclusion should be "something thinks", not "I". We may not be the thoughts, we may just be experiencing them, and the thoughts may not belong to us.
