# Importance
Social skills are among the most vital skills given how humans are social creatures. Even in industries, research shows that social skills are more important than technical skills.[^1]

# Tips
- Try to understand their perspective. Don't apply your own prejudices, experiences onto another person when their life may have been significantly different from yours.
- Treat others as you would want to be treated.
- If you're wrong, admit it quickly quickly and emphatically.
- Dramatize your ideas.
- Our first reaction to statements should be understanding.

## Appeal to the Human Desire to Feel Valued/Worthful/Important
- Become genuinely interested in others. Fully and intently listen to the other side. Let them fully express themselves and encourage them doing so.
- Smile and be cheerful/happy when socializing.
- Sincerely compliment/praise the other person. 
- Remember people's names and things about them.
- Show respect for other people's opinions. Try to understand where they are coming from. Don't just say "you're wrong".
- Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.
- Use encouragement and make the fault seem easy to correct.

### Make Them Willing to Do It
- If you want someone to do something/influence them, make them *want* to do it.
- Demonstrate to them that the idea will benefit them.
- Make the other person happy to do things you suggest.
- Talk in terms of the other person's interests.
- To persuade someone, let the person feel like the idea is theirs.
- Appeal to nobler motives.
- Throw down a challenge that'll prove the person's value.
- Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.

## Arguments/Criticisms/Proving
- Avoid arguments/criticisms/proving and give sincere compliments/appreciations. If arguments/criticisms/proving needed, then
	- Conduct them in a way that preserves the opponent's dignity/face.
	- Talk about your own mistakes before theirs.
	- Call attention to other people's mistakes indirectly.
	- Do it very subtly so that it doesn't seem like you are trying to prove something.
	- Ask questions/provide suggestions instead of ordering.

## When Beginning a Conversation
- Always begin in a friendly way, with praise and honest appreciation.
- Begin by emphasizing the things you have in common rather than the differences.
- Get the person saying "Yes"es, which make the person open-minded, rather than "No"s, which close off the person from other perspectives.
