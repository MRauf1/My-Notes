# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Closed [[Set]])
> [[Set]] containing all [[Limit of Sequence]] of [[Sequence]] consisting of the set's elements.

> [!info] Definition 2 (Closed Set in Terms of [[Metric Space]])[^1]
> Let $(S, d)$ be a [[Metric Space]]. [[Subset]] $E \subseteq S$ is a closed set if its [[Set Complement]] $S \setminus E$ is an [[Open Set]].
> $E$ is closed if $E = S \setminus U$ where $U$ is an [[Open Set]].

[[Interval Notation|Closed interval]] $[a, b]$ is a closed set.
