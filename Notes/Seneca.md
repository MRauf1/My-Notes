# Biography

Was born to an aristocratic (Equestrian) class in Corduba, Spain between 4 and 1 BC.

Went to Rome along his father and was taught by the philosopher [[Sextius]].

His entry to the political world was delayed and was short due to various troubles, such as his frail health and false accusations of adultery, which led to Seneca's exile. During his exile, he spent much of his time in philosophical and natural studies. He was a [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher.

Was the teacher of the emperor Nero. During the mentorship, he assisted Nero with civil and judicial administration of the empire. The initial period was stable until Nero killed his mother, which began the decline of Nero's reign. Ended up writing a speech for Nero, and felt compromised in his position as Nero's teacher and aid. When Seneca tried to retire (twice), Nero refused him. A later assassination attempt on Nero by Seneca's nephew dragged the innocent (at least, we think) Seneca himself into the turmoil, which led to Nero ordering Seneca's suicide.

# Wealth
Was very wealthy for which he was criticized by others, especially other Stoics. Despite the wealth though, he engaged in ascetic habits.

# Death
Was forced to commit suicide by the emperor [[Nero]]. Similar to [[Socrates]], he did not resist, and went through with it calmly. In doing so, he lived up to his own principles.

First cut his veins to bleed out, but that didn't kill him. Then asked for poison, but that didn't kill him either. Finally, went into a steaming bath, which finally killed him.
