# Number of Solutions

The value $b^2 - 4ac$ is called the discriminant because it determines the number of solutions that the quadratic function has

- $b^2 - 4ac < 0 \implies$ the quadratic function has no [[Real Number|real]] solutions (but it has [[Complex Number|complex]] solutions)
- $b^2 - 4ac = 0 \implies$ the quadratic function has $1$ real solution
- $b^2 - 4ac > 0 \implies$ the quadratic function has $2$ real solutions
