# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Bounded [[Set]])[^1]
> A set $S$ is bounded if it's [[Set Upper Bound|bounded above]] and [[Set Lower Bound|bounded below]].
> In other words, $S$ is bounded if there exist [[Real Number]] $m, M$ such that $S \subseteq [m, M]$

> [!info] Definition 2 (Bounded [[Set]] in High Dimension)[^2]
> A [[Set]] $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^k$ is bounded if there exists $M > 0$ such that $\max\{|x_j| : j = 1, \dots, k\} \leq M$ for all $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \dots, x_k) \in S$.
