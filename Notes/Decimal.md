Create a note for powers
For each number representation, show to how to convert from another representation to this one
Talk about how there is no oneth, tenth is the first digit after the dot. Prealgebra page 417.
Talk about different bases, and how the one we use is base ten. (Should this be in Number note?)
I initially forgot how to do decimal multiplication, division and such. Maybe put these as examples and such? Page 437.
For repeating decimal, maybe put an example showcasing how the overline works.
