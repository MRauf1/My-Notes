He had a large following, called the Pythagoreans, who were excellent mathematicians. The community, unlike a lot of other ancient ones, was open and welcoming to women.

Both his wife and daughter were prominent figures within the community. His wife made contributions in the realm of numbers and optics, as well as the application of the Pythagorean philosophy to the practical life. His daughter studied the application of the Pythagorean philosophy to motherhood.
