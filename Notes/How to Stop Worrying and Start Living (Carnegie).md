# Review[^1]

Book by [[Dale Carnegie]] on [[Worry]].

Similar to his other book [[How to Win Friends & Influence People (Carnegie)]] in that it is also filled with lots of anecdotes from other people.

I've read a decent amount of books that talk to some degree about the issue of worry, and as such, a lot of the material in this book is not particularly insightful or revolutionary to me.

Overall, I find this book to be less effective than the Friends one, but that may also be because I've read more books about worry than I have about social skills. Nonetheless, compared to those other books about worry, this book's recommendations are a bit superficial and surface-level - treating the symptoms rather than the cause.
