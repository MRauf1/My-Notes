# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 (Real Factorization Theorem)[^1]
> Suppose $f$ is a [[Polynomial Function|polynomial function]] with real coefficients. Then $f(x)$ can be [[Factor|factored]] into a product of [[Linear Function|linear]] factors corresponding to the real zeros of $f$ and [[Irreducible Quadratic|irreducible quadratic]] factors, which give the non-real zeros of $f$.
