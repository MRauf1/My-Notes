# Definition

Process by which we learn to associate stimuli and consequently, to anticipate events.[^1]

Assume we start off with an Unconditioned Stimulus (such as meat powder) and Unconditioned Response (such as salivation in dogs). If a Neutral Stimulus (such as a bell ring) is added immediately before the Unconditioned Stimulus, the Neutral Stimulus becomes a Conditioned Stimulus (dogs will react to the bell ring), which exhibits Conditioned Response (dogs will salivate).
