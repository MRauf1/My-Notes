# Definition

To form a [[Habit]], make it attractive.

1) Temptation Bundling ([[Premack's Principle]]) - link an action you want to do with an action you need to do.
2) Humans desire to belong. Thus, habits can be inherited from the close, the many, the powerful.
	1) For the close, join a culture of people where your desired habit is the normal habit. Shared identity of the community will reinforce your personal identity.
	2) For the many, if habit goes along with the group, it will be attractive and vice versa.
	3) For the powerful, if a habit can get you approval/respect/praise, it will be attractive and vice versa.
3) Perspective/Mindset Change - habits become more attractive if they're associated with a positive experience.
	1) For example, you get to (not have to) do a hard task.
	2) Motivation Ritual - do something you enjoy before a difficult habit.
4) Tasks that are of "just manageable difficulty" (at the edge of your current abilities) provide the most amount of motivation.
	1) The sweet spot of desire is at the 50/50 split for success and failure.
