# Definition

...

Focus on the systems that build progress, rather than the goals (both losers and winners have the same goals, but different systems). Goal is a momentary change, while a system is a lifelong process. A good system will lead to your goal, but achieving a goal alone, may not completely fix the problem.[^1]

Derive pleasure from the system/process itself rather than the goal. Goal achieving is binary, either you get it or not, but system building is continuous as there are numerous ways to build a satisfying system.

System keeps pushing you even after goal has been accomplished. Pursue endless refinement and improvement rather than goal achieving.
