# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 (Fundamental Theorem of [[Cyclic Group]])
> Let $G = <g>$, $o(g) = n < \infty$
> - Every [[Subgroup]] of $G$ is [[Cyclic Subgroup]]
> - $a \in \mathbb{Z} \implies <g^a> = <g^d>$, where $d = gcd(a, n)$
> - $a|n, b|n \implies (<g^a> \subseteq <g^b> \iff b | a)$
> - Each subgroup of $G$ is $<g^d>$ for a unique $d > 0$, and $d|n, |<g^d>| = \frac{n}{d}$ (This means that in a cyclic group, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $n$ (for a given element $g$), and the subgroup is a cyclic group with the generator having order of a divisor of $n$, which is not guaranteed for general groups in the [[Order Theorem]])
