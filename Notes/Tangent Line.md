# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Tangent [[Line]])[^1]
> Tangent line to a [[Curve]] is a line that touches the curve. It has the same direction as the curve at that [[Point]].

> [!info] Definition 2 ([[Slope]] of Tangent Line)
> The slope of tangent line is the [[Limit]] of the slopes of the [[Secant Line]],
> $$
> \begin{align}
> \lim_{Q \rightarrow P} m_{PQ} = m
> \end{align}
> $$
> where $m$ is the slope, $P$ is the [[Point]] at which the tangent line touches the curve, and $Q$ is the second [[Point]] at which the secant line touches the curve.
