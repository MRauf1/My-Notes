# Definition

...

Meaning can come from overcoming challenges and helping others.

Life contains meaning even under any and all conditions ([[Existentialism]] perspective).[^1]

A proper knowledge of one's meaning can help one survive even the worst of atrocities. As [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] said: "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how".

# Uniqueness and Change of Meaning
Meaning of life is unique to each person. Furthermore, it can change, develop, and evolve throughout time, and is not always constant. It never ceases to be. It is unconditional.

Each person must accept the responsibility that stems from their answer. If they succeed, they will grow despite all of the challenges.

# Relationship Between Human and Life
It's not the human asking life what their meaning of life is. It is life asking the human what their meaning of life is, and it is the human who has to answer life.

# [[Viktor Frankl]]'s View
Will to meaning is the primary motivational force in humans.

To find meaning of life, one must look at and pursue a cause greater than oneself. This necessarily implies that meaning of life is pursued not just internally, but it has an external component too. In particular, Frankl provides 3 ways of finding meaning:
1) Creating a work or doing a deed.
2) Experiencing something or encountering someone.
3) By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering (Note that this does not imply that suffering is *necessary* for meaning. Avoidable/Unnecessary suffering is masochistic, not heroic).

# [[Existentialism|Existential]] Vacuum
It manifests itself in a state of boredom.

Can lead to suicide in the worst case.

# Losing Meaning of Life
Once lost, the will to live seldom returned.

# Temporary Meaning of Life
Any attempt to restore a human's inner strength had to start by showing them some future goal to look forward to.

# Life as the One Asking the Question
Doesn't matter what we expect of life, but what life expects of us. Stop asking for meaning of life and think of ourselves as being questioned by life. Life means taking the responsibility to find the right answers to its problems. Meaning of life, therefore, comes from the finding of answers to life's problems that it presents to us. Meaning of life embraces the wider cycles of life and death, of suffering and dying. It's not some goal to be completed.
