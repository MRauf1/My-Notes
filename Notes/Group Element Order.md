Order of a group element is the cardinality of the [[Subgroup Generated by Subset]] with the subset consisting only of that element.

# Properties
## Order as Getting to Identity
- $o(a) = n < \infty \implies$ $n$ is the smallest positive integer such that $a^n = e$
- $o(a) = \infty \implies a^n \neq e$ for $n > 0$

## Element Order from [[Group Order]]
- [[Even Order Theorem]]
- [[Cauchy Theorem]]

## [[Group Isomorphism]]
For a group $G, a \in G, <a> \leq G$
- $o(a) = n < \infty \implies <a> \cong \mathbb{Z}_n$
- $o(a) = \infty \implies <a> \cong \mathbb{Z}$
