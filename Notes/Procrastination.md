# Definition

The act of putting off tasks/activities until later, while knowing the negative consequences of doing so.

Activates the areas of brain associated with pain ([[Insular Cortex|insular cortex]]).[^1] In other words, the task is treated as something uncomfortable/painful/unpleasant (e.g. due to a fear of failure). Consequently, brain tries to avoid the task.

However, research shows that not long after beginning to work on the unpleasant activity, the neural discomfort disappears.

Therefore, it is best to concentrate on the process (the act of doing) rather than on the outcome. Rather than working to finish a given problem (outcome), instead, give yourself a set amount of time, and work on the problem until the time runs out without worrying about whether you'll achieve the outcome or not (process).[^2] This results in [[Focused Mode|focusing]] on the problem and potentially achieving a [[Flow State|flow state]] rather than judging yourself over whether you'll finish the problem or not. The processes can then give rise to [[Habit|habits]].
