# Definition

...

One part of consciousness. Thus, should be used as a tool only when needed to.[^1]

# Thinker
The thinker is part of you, but it is not the whole you. Let the observer part of you impartially observe the thinker and lessen its power.[^1]

The thinker is biased and sees everything not necessarily as things are.

# Emotional vs. Rational
Emotional thinking comes first as part of the nonconscious and optimized process. Rational thinking follows after as part of the conscious and deliberate process.[^2]

Emotions organize rather than disrupt our rational thinking.[^3]
