# Definition

...

For two observations of the identical thing by two different observers, the visual experience is also dependent on prior knowledge, such as what we know, what we are doing, and what we expect to see.[^1]

Sometimes, the image itself is not enough, and we need the context of the image (such as surrounding parts of the image) in order to understand the image itself.[^2]
