The arithmetic mean is the average of a set of numbers. Its symbol is $\overline{x}$.

#TODO 

- Update the mean to the arithmetic mean since mean will eventually have stuff like geometric mean (or maybe separate arithmetic and geometric means into their own notes, while mean is the general one that links to them both?)
