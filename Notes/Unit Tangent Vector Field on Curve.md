# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Unit Tangent [[Vector Field on Curve]])[^1]
> Let $\beta: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ be a [[Unit Speed Curve]]. Then $T(s) = \beta'(s)$ is the unit tangent [[Vector Field on Curve]] $\beta$.

# Types
- [[Curvature Vector Field on Curve]]

#TODO 
Should it be T=beta'? Equals makes little sense since their ranges are different.
