# Definition

Real number is a [[Number|number]] that is either [[Rational Number]] or [[Irrational Number]].[^1]

#TODO
- Include a diagram like on page 607 for numbers, but in the numbers sections. Could also have part of it for real numbers though.
- Unrelated, but create a unit of measurement note or something like that for chapter 7.5
