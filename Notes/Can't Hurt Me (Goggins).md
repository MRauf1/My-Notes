# Review

An autobiography by [[David Goggins|David Goggins]] about his very difficult life in which he has been through severe child abuse, which heavily shaped the rest of his life. Taking in and transforming all the abuse and trauma, he was able to push himself way beyond his limits to become a Navy SEAL, an Army Ranger, an ultramarathoner, a wildland firefighter, and now studying to be an EMT specialist.

It is a great book showcasing the limits of human potential and how those limits can be broken. It teaches strict discipline as a way to move forward in life (replacing the fleeting motivation) and achieve one's goals. It also teaches the importance of AARs (After Action Reports) where after some event, one takes the time to analyze the said event and its consequence in order to learn from the past.

At the same time, it also shows the dangers of pushing yourself far beyond the limits as Goggins has permanently damaged his body through pushing himself beyond his physical limits, which ended up noticeable damaging his quality of life. The lesson thus is to push oneself to the limits (and know that those limits can be broken), but take care not to be overambitious as that can leave one's body broken. 

The book also paints a clear picture for the psychological traumas and issues that Goggins faces and struggles with, which may very well be the causes of certain life struggles, such as Goggins' broken families and divorces, and his relationships with his squadmates and others.
