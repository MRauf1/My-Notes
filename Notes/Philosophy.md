# Definition

The word derives from ancient Greek and means the pursuer (philia) of wisdom (sophia).[^1]

# Purpose

First, the purpose is the pleasure from questioning the question, similar to the love of pure math from a mathematician even if there are no practical aspects. The mental joy comes from the philosophical engagement itself. It is an act of self-reflection.

Second, continuous philosophical practice influences our [[Thought|thinking]], and our thinking influences our state of mind as well as our subsequent actions. A [[Nihilism|nihilist]] may be paralyzed because of their philosophy, while an [[Existentialism|existentialist]] may move forward with a strong reason. 

In particular, philosophical engagement can give rise to clever ideas that were unthought of before, such as [[Albert Einstein]] thinking about [[Epistemology]] to come up with an idea of [[Special Theory of Relativity]]. On the other hand, a certain philosophical thinking may get you stuck on an idea that is then hard to break out of and see other perspectives.

Therefore, it is this process of self-reflection through philosophy that gives a better understanding of oneself as well as the universe. It is this that grants us the most freedom. And it is this that can positively or negatively change our mind and life.
