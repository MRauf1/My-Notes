# Definition

...

Happiness is active and fleeting. Contentment is passive.

Happiness can come from overcoming challenges.

Happiness is a result of our inner thoughts. Two people with the same physical conditions can be happy and unhappy depending on their mental point of view. Therefore, foster a positive mindset to get a continual state of contentment.

One way of becoming happy is by acting happy, as the action will increase the likelihood of the feeling coming.
