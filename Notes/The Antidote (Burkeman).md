# Review[^1]

Book by [[Oliver Burkeman]], which is, in part a satire for the "cult of optimism" and other related self-help books, and in another part, is a self-help book demonstrating the path of "negativity" towards happiness.

The book is a stitched together collection of various philosophies, including [[Stoicism]], [[Buddhism]], concepts, such as failure, [[Self]], death ([[Memento Mori]]), and more.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book to others. There isn't anything too transformative or insightful about the book. Instead, if someone is interested in these concepts/philosophies, then I'd suggest they dive into the core resources of these concepts/philosophies instead.
