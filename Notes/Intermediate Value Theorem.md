# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Intermediate Value Theorem (Zero Version))[^1]
> For a [[Continuous Function]] $f$ on the [[Interval Notation|interval]] $[a, b]$ and number $N$ such that $f(a) \leq N \leq f(b)$ with $f(a) \neq f(b)$, then there exists a number $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f(c) = N$.

Continuous function takes on every intermediate value.

If $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs, then the function has at least one zero between $x = a$ and $x = b$.
