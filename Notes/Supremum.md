# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Supremum)[^1]
> If a [[Set]] $S$ is [[Set Upper Bound|bounded above]] and has a least upper bound, then the least upper bound is called the supremum of $S$ and denoted as $sup S$. If a set $S$ is not bounded above, then $sup S = \infty$.
> In other words, if $S$ is bounded above, then $M = sup S$ if and only if
> 1) $s \leq M, \forall s \in S$
> 2) Whenever $M_1 < M$, then there exists $s_1 \in S$ such that $s_1 > M_1$

Supremum is a least upper bound on a set $S$.
