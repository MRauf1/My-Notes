# Review[^1]

Fantastic book by [[James Clear]] all throughout. Goes straight to the point, showcases the motivation between pursuing better habits, breaks down the 4 parts of habits, and then dives deeply into each one of them. All of the points are nice and succinct with just enough examples so that the main idea is properly displayed without any redundancy.

I especially liked the beginning of the book where he dives into the identity of individuals and how the identity is responsible for all that humans do, and how important it therefore is. He then goes on to show the motivation for habits through identity and how the two can endlessly keep reinforcing each other in a loop.

Highly recommend this book to everyone.
