# Definition

Chemical messengers that must bind to a [[Receptor]] to send their signal.[^1]

Hormones are secreted into the bloodstream, travel through the body, and affect any cells with appropriate [[Receptor]]. Unlike [[Neurotransmitter]] whose effects are localized, the effects of hormones are widespread.

Compared to [[Neurotransmitter]], they are slower to take effect, but longer lasting.
