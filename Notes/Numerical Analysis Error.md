# Definition

[[Error]] present in [[Numerical Analysis]].[^1]

Conditioning is for the [[Propagated Data Error]], while stability is for the [[Computational Error]]. Accuracy is the closeness of the computed solution to the true solution. Thus, a solution is accurate if it is both well-conditioned and stable.

# Types
