# Review[^1]

Book on [[Philosophy]] by [[OpenStax]].

The book is pretty decent, going through the major thinkers and the major periods of time in philosophy and introducing the reader to the field. The book also addresses non-Western philosophy too and discusses some feminist philosophies too, which might set it apart from the other books.

The last chapter, in particular, was quite insightful with brief descriptions of the late modern philosophy of the past 1-2 centuries.
