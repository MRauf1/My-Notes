# Definition

For decisions that require the applications of strict rules/concentrated thinking, the [[Consciousness]] mind must be involved.

For decisions involving large amounts of information, vagueness, constraints, the [[Unconsciousness]] is better suited for it.[^1]

In a study by [[Ap Dijksterhuis]], the distracted group performed better on a complex decision of buying a car compared to the non-distract, showing the benefit of letting the unconscious mind sorting out the information too.
