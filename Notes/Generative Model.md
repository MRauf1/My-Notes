# Definition

Models that generate new data examples that are [[Statistics|statistically]] indistinguishable from the training examples. Some models learn the probability distribution of the data and sample from it, while others learn a mechanism for generation without describing the distribution.[^1]

These models rely on the statistics of the training data, and as such, do not truly understand the significance of their answers.
