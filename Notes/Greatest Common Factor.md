# Definition

Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of $\geq 2$ [[Expression|expressions]] is the largest expression that is a [[Factor|factor]] of all the expressions.[^1]

> [!example]- Examples 1 (Greatest Common Factor)
> > [!example]- Example 1.1 (Greatest Common Factor of 2 Numbers)
> > $GCF(12, 60) = 12$
> 
> > [!example]- Example 1.2 (Greatest Common Factor of 2 Monomials)
> >$GCF(2x, x^2) = x$
>
> > [!example]- Example 1.3 (Greatest Common Factor of 2 Polynomials)
> > $GCF(2x + 3y^2, x^2 + 2y) = x + y$
