# Review[^1]

Book by [[Eric Matthes]] on the programming language of [[Python]].

The book is designed for beginners, and as such, it does a pretty good job of not being overly complex. The material is indeed for beginners, containing the basic programming material, such as statements, loops, OOP, and such.

The book does not dive deeply into its topics, but covers only the main essentials of those topics. As such, it was not dense enough to my liking. I ended up learning only a couple of things overall, when I was looking for a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.

The book is divided into 2 parts. The first part is teaching Python, while the second part is teaching Python through projects.

The above review is only for the first part as I have not read the second part.
