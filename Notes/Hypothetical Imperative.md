# Definition

Imperative that is a means to achieve a goal/fulfill a desire.[^1] It is not a [[Moral Imperative]] as such action is neither praise or blame-worthy.

As [[Immanuel Kant]] put it, the imperative "says only that the action is good for some actual or possible purpose."

#TODO 
- Learn a better definition and how it differs from categorical imperative.
