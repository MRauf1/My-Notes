# Definition

[[Neuromodulator|Neuromodulator]] responsible for motivation/craving/desire. Dopamine neurons are a part of the brain system that controls reward learning. 

The chemical dopamine is released when you receive an unexpected reward or anticipate a reward (reward system for receiving a reward and anticipating a reward is the same). It is involved in the prediction of future rewards and a corresponding amounts of dopamine are released with the rewards.[^1]

Loss of dopamine can lead to lack of motivation and [[Anhedonia|anhedonia]]. Severe loss of dopamine can lead to [[Parkinson's Disease|Parkinson's Disease]] and [[Catanonia|catanonia]].

# Discovery

It was originally discovered in a 1954 experiment by neuroscientists [[James Olds]] and [[Peter Milner]] where the inhibition of dopamine in rats led to the rats losing all will to live.

# Dopamine Spike

1) Dopamine is spiked when the reward is experienced for the first time
2) Dopamine is spiked when the reward is anticipated (dopamine won't rise when a reward is experienced because reward is already expected)
3) Dopamine will spike in anticipation, but will drop below baseline if reward is not experienced
4) Dopamine will spike in anticipation, start to drop below baseline when reward is not experienced, but spike again when the reward is experienced (reward has been delayed)
