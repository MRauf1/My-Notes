# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 ([[Function Composition]] with [[Injective Function]], [[Surjective Function]], [[Bijective Function]])
> Let $f: A \rightarrow B, g: B \rightarrow C$ be [[Function]]
> - If $f, g$ are injective, then $g \circ f$ is injective.
> - If $f, g$ are surjective, then $g \circ f$ is surjective.
> - If $f, g$ are bijective, then $g \circ f$ is bijective.
> - If $g \circ f$ is injective, then $f$ is injective.
