Percent change is how much [[Percent|percent]] a [[Number|number]] has changed from its original amount.

If the initial number is greater than the final number, then there has been a percent decrease. If the initial number is less than the final number, then there has been a percent increase.[^1]


#TODO 
- Add example
- Is this the same formula as percent error?
- Percent difference is actually a slightly different formula. Apparently this is more of a relative change or something. Research this more.
