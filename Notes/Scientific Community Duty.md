# Definition

As the scientific community is the "carrier"/medium through which scientific progress takes place, the scientific community imposes duties on its members.

The primary duties are
1) Evaluation of scientific work
2) Consolidation of accumulated knowledge (in forms like books)
3) Education of future generations of researchers.[^1]
