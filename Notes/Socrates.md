# Definition

Ancient Greek philosopher and [[Plato]]'s teacher, hailed by many as the founder of [[Philosophy]].[^1]

He didn't write any works himself and looked down on writing, in general.

Unlike other philosophers of the era, he prided himself on knowing how little he knew.

He was good at exposing the weaknesses in the argumentations of others.

Rather than stating his "truth", he would use reason to help others to arrive at the truth.

# Philosophy

In his work, he made use of (and is the creator of) the [[Socratic Method]].

## Self

He believed that the purpose of life is the process of examination of oneself and famously claimed that "the life which is unexamined is not worth living".

Examining oneself is to investigates one's beliefs and inconsistencies in beliefs, to pursue knowledge of oneself and the world as a whole, whilst realizing the limit of one's knowledge.

According to Socrates, real learning comes only through self-discovery.

## Ethics

Socrates believed in the [[Socrates Harm Principle]].
