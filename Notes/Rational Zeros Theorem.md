# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 ([[Rational Number|Rational]] Zeros Theorem)[^1]
> Suppose $f$ is a [[Polynomial Function|polynomial function]] with a [[Degree of Polynomial|degree]] $n \geq 1$ and with [[Integer|integer]] [[Coefficient|coefficients]] $a_0, \dots, a_n$. If $r$ is a rational zero of $f$, then $r$ is of the form $\pm \frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a [[Factor|factor]] of $a_0$, and $q$ is a factor of $a_n$.

If none of the rationals are zeros, then either the polynomial function has no real zeros, or all of the real zeros are [[Irrational Number|irrational]].
