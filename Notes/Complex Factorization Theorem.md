# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 ([[Complex Number|Complex]] [[Factor|Factorization]] Theorem)[^1]
> Suppose $f$ is a [[Polynomial Function|polynomial function]] with complex [[Coefficient|coefficients]]. If the [[Degree of Polynomial|degree]] is $n \geq 1$, then $f$ has exactly $n$ complex zeros (including [[Multiplicity|multiplicity]]). If $z_1, \dots, z_k$ are the distinct zeros of $f$ with multiplicities $m_1, \dots, m_k$, then $f(x) = a(x - z_1)^{m_1} \dots (x - z_k)^{m_k}$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient of $f(x)$.

A polynomial function is determined by the leading coefficient, its zeros, and their multiplicities.
