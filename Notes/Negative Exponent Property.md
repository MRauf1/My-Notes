Base raised to a negative [[Exponentiation|power]] is the [[Reciprocal|reciprocal]] of the [[Number|number]] with the negative sign in the power removed.

An [[Expression|expression]] with a negative exponent is not in its [[Simplest Form|simplest form]].

#TODO 

- Simplest form? Link it to simplify note instead.
- Is the 2nd paragraph too? I've been keeping negatives sometimes to avoid fractions and it seemed to be fine. Research a bit more.
- Scientific notation note for page 931
- Commutative and associative property -> can they be extended to n numbers? Same with distributive.
