# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Frenet [[Curve]])
> A [[Unit Speed Curve]] $\beta$ is a Frenet Curve if the [[Vector Field on Curve]] $\beta', \dots, \beta^{(n - 1)}$ form a [[Linearly Independent]] [[Set]].
> In that case, the [[Frenet Frame Field]] is obtained from $\beta', \dots, \beta^{(n-1)}$ by using the [[Gram-Schmidt Algorithm]] to get $E_1, \dots, E_{n-1}$ and then $E_n$ is chosen so that $E_1, \dots, E_{n-1}$ is a [[Orientation Preserving Curve Reparameterization|positively oriented frame]].

#TODO 
What is positively oriented frame? Maybe an example?
