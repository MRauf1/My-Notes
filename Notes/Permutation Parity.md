# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Permutation Parity)
> [[Permutation]] $\sigma$ of a finite [[Set]] written as a product of [[Transposition]] $\sigma = \tau_1 \cdot \dots \cdot \tau_n$ has parity of $n$, where the permutation is even if $n$ is [[Even Number]] and permutation is odd if $n$ is [[Odd Number]]

# Permutation Products

- (Even Permutation) $\cdot$ (Even Permutation) $=$ (Even Permutation)
- (Odd Permutation) $\cdot$ (Even Permutation) $=$ (Odd Permutation)
- (Odd Permutation) $\cdot$ (Odd Permutation) $=$ (Even Permutation)

Even though they are products, think of them as adding odd and even numbers.

# Properties

> [!abstract] Theorem 2
> For a permutation $\sigma$ of a finite set, if $\sigma = \tau_1 \cdot \dots \cdot \tau_k = v_1 \cdot \dots v_l$ where $\tau_i, v_j$ are transpositions, then either $k, l$ are both even or both odd, i.e. $(-1)^k = (-1)^l$


#TODO 
- Is the last permutation product correct?
