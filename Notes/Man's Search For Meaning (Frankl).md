# Review[^1]

[[Existentialism|Existentialist]] piece of text by [[Viktor Frankl]], which is divided into 2 parts. The first one is the author's experiences in the concentration camps, while the second one is the description of the author's psychotherapy known as [[Logotherapy]].

Phenomenal piece of literature that examines the survival of humans under, perhaps, the worst of conditions to be experienced in human history. Author shows the struggles of the prisoners, their vying for meaning in all of this senseless and irrational suffering. Through this text, the strength and possibilities of humanity are displayed even when they are at their weakest moments. 

The text touches on many concepts such as the meaning of life, meaning of suffering, free will, fate, and more philosophical and psychological concepts.

Highly recommend to everyone.
