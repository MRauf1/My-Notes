# Definition

For a [[Prediction]] task $\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(X)$, the difference between $f$ (ideal estimate) and $\hat{f}$ (predicted estimate) is what introduces the reducible error.[^1]

This error can be reduced by finding a better estimate $\hat{f}$ with the error equaling $0$ by having $\hat{f} = f$.
