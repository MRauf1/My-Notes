# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Dihedral Group)
> [[Group]] of [[n-gon]] with $n \geq 3$ with [[Symmetry]] operations
> $D_n \leq D \leq SO(3)$
> $D_n = <r, j> = \{r^0, \dots, r^{n-1}, r^0j, \dots, r^{n-1}j\}$, where $r = r_{2\pi / n}, j = j_0$ and with the properties $r^{k + n} = r^k$, $r^n = e$, $j^2 = e$, $jr = r^{-1}j$
> $|D_n| = 2n$
