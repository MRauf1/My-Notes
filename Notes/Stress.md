# Definition

...

It is a result of the condition of our mind, such as mental state, habits, thoughts, perceptions, and more.

Desire is a force that generates stress due to a desire of wanting more, a desire to be enough, and a desire to not be some negative quality. These result in constant pursuit of pleasure and constant fleeing of pain, and an overall ignorance of most of the perceived experience.

# Function
In moderate amounts, stress can be beneficial to human function (good stress is called eustress).

# The Ones Who Have Everything
History shows us that even those who have everything are not necessarily content. Even then, all of these are fleeting. Present now, but gone eventually. Imagine yourself falling victim to an international disaster, like a war or an economic collapse. All of these might be gone, and what are you left with? It is this inner self that is always present with oneself and that should be strengthened and looked after. Even without anything else, a human would be able to live on with this present.

## Inward Inspection
To make a change, one must first understand oneself. Rather than controlling external events, which is impossible, focus on yourself instead. By understanding ourselves first, we also become able to understand others too. The introspection leads to a heightened ability of forgiveness, love, compassion.

## Assuming Control
People who report higher rates of perceived control view their health as controllable, making it more likely for them to better manage their health and life.
