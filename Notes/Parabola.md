# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Parabola)[^1]
> Let $F$ be a [[Point]] and $D$ a [[Line]] not containing $F$. A parabola is the [[Set]] of all [[Point]] equidistant from $F$ and $D$. $F$ is called the focus, and $D$ is called the directrix.
> [[Vertex]] $V$ is the [[Point]] closest to $F$ with the distance between them being the focal length $|p|$.
> Latus Rectum is the [[Line Segment]] [[Parallel Line]] to the directrix and containing $F$. The length of latus rectum, called the focal diameter, is $|4p|$.

> [!info] Definition 2 (Vertical Parabola Equation)
> Equation for a vertical parabola with vertex $(h, k)$ and focal length $|p|$ is
> $$
> \begin{align}
> (x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)
> \end{align}
> $$
> If $p > 0$, parabola opens upwards, and if $p < 0$, parabola opens downwards.

> [!info] Definition 3 (Horizontal Parabola Equation)
> Equation for a horizontal parabola with vertex $(h, k)$ and focal length $|p|$ is
> $$
> \begin{align}
> (y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)
> \end{align}
> $$
> If $p > 0$, parabola opens rightwards, and if $p < 0$, parabola opens leftwards.
