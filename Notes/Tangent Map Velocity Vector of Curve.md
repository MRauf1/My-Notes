# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Tangent Map]] [[Velocity Vector of Smooth Curve]] of [[Curve]])[^1]
> Let $F: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a [[Mapping]]. If $\beta = F(\alpha)$ is the image of a [[Curve]] $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\beta'(t) = F_*(a'(t))$.

Mappings preserve the velocities of curves.

#TODO 
Preserve in what sense? Because they don't have to be equal ($\beta' \neq \alpha'$).
