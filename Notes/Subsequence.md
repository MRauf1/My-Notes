# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Subsequence)[^1]
> Let $(s_n)$ be a [[Sequence]]. Subsequence of the sequence is a sequence $(t_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ where for each $k$, there is a natural number $n_k$ such that
> $$
> \begin{align}
> n_1 < n_2 < \dots < n_k < n_{k + 1} < \dots

> \begin{align}
> t_k = s_{n_k}
> \end{align}

Subsequence $(t_k)$ is a collection of some or all of the $s_n$'s taken in order.
