# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Curvature]] [[Vector Field on Curve]])[^1]
> Given a [[Unit Tangent Vector Field on Curve]] $T(s) = \beta'(s)$, its derivative $T'(s) = \beta''(s)$ is the curvature vector field of $\beta$.
> In particular, $T'(s)$ is [[Orthogonal Vector|orthogonal]] to $T(s)$ ([[Normal Vector]] to $\beta$).

It measures the way the [[Curve]] is turning in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
