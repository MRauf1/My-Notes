# Definition

A technique for [[Polynomial Division|dividing polynomials]] by divisors of form $(x - c)$.[^1] The resulting polynomial will be of [[Degree of Polynomial|degree]] $1$ less than the polynomial being divided. By the uniqueness of the quotient in polynomial division, the quotient polynomial is unique.
