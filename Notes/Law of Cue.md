# Definition

To form a [[Habit]], make it obvious.

1) Raise awareness of cue/habit to conscious level using something like the Pointing-and-Calling system.
2) Most common cues are time and location. Thus, create a specific plan for implementing an action/habit X at time Y in location Z.
3) Design your environment to incentivize cues/habits you want and to disincentivize cues/habits you don't want.
	1) Habits are easier to change in a new environment.
	2) Keep the contexts of distinct habits distinct.
4) Disciplined people structure their lives/environments in a way that does not require a lot of willpower/motivation/self-control.
	1) Once a habit has formed, it can be minimized, but it cannot be completely forgotten.
	2) Best way to reduce a bad habit is to reduce exposure to its cue.
