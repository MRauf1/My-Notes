# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Differentiable)[^1]
> [[Function]] $f$ is differentiable at $a$ if $f'(a)$ exists. It is differentiable on the [[Interval Notation|open interval]] $(a, b)$ if it is differentiable at every number in the interval.
> Function is not differentiable if 
> 1) Its graph has "corners" or "kinks" in it. 
> 2) If a function is not continuous, then it is not differentiable.
> 3) If it has a [[Vertical Line]] [[Tangent Line]]: $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} |f'(x)| = \infty$


It is defined for open intervals only because limits require that points exist on both sides near the point at question, which a closed interval doesn't provide at the endpoints.
