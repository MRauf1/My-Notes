# Review

A decent book by [[Mark Manson]] addressing a number of valuable points in today's society, but mainly emphasizing the focus on matters that are important to oneself and the lack of focus on all the other matters. In other words, the lesson is to give priority to things that truly matter.

It's not revolutionary or too out of the ordinary. The book doesn't hold any ancient secrets or anything of the sort. It's simple, but valuable advice that I'd imagine a lot of people accrue on their own throughout their life. Ideas such as focusing on what's important, taking responsibility for your life, accepting yourself as you are and so on.

The one interesting point that he made was regarding the personal values that are in control of us as well as the metrics by which we evaluate our personal values. These two make up a major portion of one's perspective in life and internal motivators and such, and because of that, they are of very high value. In particular, one needs to choose healthy personal values and metrics to live a healthy lives. The book addresses these points, provides a few criteria for determining which values are healthy, and the author gives his own recommendation of 5 different values, which make up the second-ish half of the book.
