One-dimensional object/space that is locally [[Euclidean 1-Space]]/"flat" embedded in some higher dimensional space. Doesn't have to be globally Euclidean.

One way of thinking of a curve is as a trip of a moving [[Point]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

The image of the curve is called the trace of the curve.
