- Bias and Fairness
	- Modern [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] learns from the training data, but if the training data is biased, then the AI itself becomes biased and unfair.[^1]
- Explainability
	- Modern AI is so complex that it cannot be properly explained as to why it does certain actions.
- Weaponization
	- Modern AI is already being used for war purposes.
- Concentration of Power
	- Modern AI is being exploited and used by the advanced global companies, and this will concentrate even more power in their hands, while the lower class will unlikely see benefits
- Existential Risk
	- Modern AI is advancing very quickly and there is no proper regulation of the technology. It may end up that the technology surpasses humanity and will not be able to be controlled/regulated by humans, which may pose an existential risk.
