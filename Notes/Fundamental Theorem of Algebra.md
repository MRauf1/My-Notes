> [!abstract] Theorem 1 (Fundamental Theorem of [[Algebra|Algebra]])[^1]
> A [[Polynomial Function|polynomial function]] $f$ with [[Complex Number|complex]] [[Coefficient|coefficients]] and [[Degree of Polynomial|degree]] $n \geq 1$ has $\geq 1$ complex zero.
> Alternatively, every such polynomial function has exactly $n$ complex roots (including [[Multiplicity|multiplicity]])
