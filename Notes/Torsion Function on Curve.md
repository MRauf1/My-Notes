> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Curvature]] [[Function]] on [[Curve]])[^1]
> Given a [[Curve]] $\beta: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$, the torsion function on $\beta$ is $\tau: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that

> Where $N$ is the [[Principal Normal Vector Field on Curve]] and $B$ is the [[Binormal Vector Field on Curve]] of the [[Frenet Frame Field]] of $\beta$.
> $\tau$ measures the [[Torsion]]/twisting of the curve $\beta$.
