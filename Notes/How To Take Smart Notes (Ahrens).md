# Review[^1]

Book by [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] on the importance of writing and taking smart notes. In particular, the author adheres to the note-taking system of [[Zettelkasten]]. 

In particular, I find his view of writing as being the medium of research and the one part of learning from which the other parts of learning stem from quite fascinating.

I really like that the author constantly provides sources for his claims from various past researches.

There is a lot of redundancy within the book. The text can easily be shortened to a single blog post instead.

Some points are not properly explained, such as the difference between Zettelkasten and Wikipedia-type system.

Overall, nothing too ground-breaking or life-altering about this book, and it does repeat itself over and over, so I'm not sure if I'd recommend it to others. I'd direct someone to the Zettelkasten website instead, probably. The one thing, however, is that I found the author's point of view on writing and note-taking and how it establishes so much of the overall learning process quite insightful.
