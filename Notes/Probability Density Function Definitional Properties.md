# Definition

These assume that $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and as such, $S = \text{support}(X)$.

1) $f(x) > 0, x \in S$
2) $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)dx = 1$
3) $P(X \in A) = \int_{x \in A} f(x)dx$, where $A \subseteq S$
4) Because $f(x)$ is not a [[Probability]], $f(x)$ can be $> 1$ for some $x$ as long as it integrates to $[0, 1]$.
