# Definition

Writing is the medium of research and studying is nothing more than research itself. As such, the very way we write and take notes ends up affecting the way that we study and conduct research. The act of writing then becomes the very foundation upon which all other tasks are based on and stem from.[^1] This way, once starting on a topic to research, you already have information regarding it because you have written it. The topics/questions/ideas then manifest naturally with supporting material.
