# Definition

An angle is formed by two [[Ray|rays]] that share a common [[Endpoint|endpoint]]. Each ray is the side of the angle, while the endpoint is the vertex, which also names the angle ($\angle A$ is the angle with vertex at point $A$. The measure of $\angle A$ is $m \angle A$).[^1]

Angles are measured in either radians or degrees (with $^{\circ}$ symbol).

# Types

- [[Complementary Angles|Complementary Angles]]
- [[Supplementary Angles|Supplementary Angles]]


#TODO 
- Talk about different angles like 90, 180, 360
- Use more rigorous definition on page 756 for complementary and supplementary angles
