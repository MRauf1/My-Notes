# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 (Zero [[Derivative]] Implies [[Constant Function]] Theorem)[^1]
> If $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x \in (a, b)$, then $f$ is constant on $(a, b)$.

> [!abstract] Corollary 2 ([[Constant Function]] as Difference)
> If $f'(x) = g'(x)$ for all $x \in (a, b)$, then $f - g$ is constant on $(a, b)$, or in other words, $f(x) = g(x) + c$ for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$.

If two [[Function]] have the same [[Derivative]], then their graphs are [[Vertical Shift]] of each other.
