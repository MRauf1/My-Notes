# Definition

Learning to associate a behavior and its consequence.[^1]

One approach is shaping, where you reward successive approximations of target behavior. This is used when the target behavior is too complex to be performed in one go, so you slowly teach the steps instead.

Inspired [[Reinforcement Learning]].

# Types of Consequences
- Positive Reinforcement (Most Effective)
	- Something is added to increase likelihood of behavior.
- Negative Reinforcement
	- Something is removed to increase likelihood of behavior.
- Positive Punishment
	- Something is added to decrease likelihood of behavior.
- Negative Punishment
	- Something is removed to decrease likelihood of behavior.

# Types of Reinforcement Schedules
- Fixed Interval
	- Reinforcement delivered at predictable time intervals
- Variable Interval
	- Reinforcement delivered at unpredictable time intervals
- Fixed Ratio
	- Reinforcement delivered after a predictable number of responses
- Variable Ratio (Most Powerful)
	- Reinforcement delivered after an unpredictable number of responses
