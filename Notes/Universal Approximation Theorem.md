# Definition

[[Deep Neural Network|DNNs]] are universal approximation [[Function|functions]] meaning that they can approximate any continuous function on compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^N$ (cannot fit non-computable functions). This holds true even for a DNN with only one hidden layer.[^1]

#TODO 
- Go to the link or another resource and write down the idea behind the proof construction (using the weighted bumps)
