# [[Metaphysics]]
Stoics believe that the universe is a rationally ordered whole based on reason and that everything that happens happens for a reason. This order is also a moral order.

They believed that order was deterministic. Nonetheless, they also believed that [[Free Will]] is compatible with [[Determinism]].

This rational capacity is inherent in all humans, and it has boundless worth in every human, so every human is equal in worth by virtue (including slaves and women). It is also this rational capacity, in their minds, that distinguished humans from animals.

Rational capacity is the only thing with inherent worth. All else are "preferred indifferents". As such, they advocated for *apatheia* - freedom from passions (similar to [[Buddhism]]).

Believed that nothing except this rational capacity lies in our control. Emotions come in relation to the external events, and therefore, are not valued or emphasized, even positive ones. True joy comes from this rational capacity.

# Slavery
Slaves can achieve internal freedom despite the external circumstances. This outlook ignores the plights of slaves.

# Women
Women can achieve internal freedom despite the external circumstances. This outlook ignores the plights of women.

They did approve education of women, but didn't propose any other substantial changes to how women were treated and their position in the government and society.

Overall, despite their certain beliefs, Stoics a lot of the time did not venture far away from the status quo.

# Influence
Stoicism has heavily influenced the [[Christian Philosophy]] and [[Early Modern Philosophy]].

Stoicism has heavily influenced the history of literature.

# Politics
Were known to counsel retirement from politics.

Believed that upheaval is worse than lawless tyranny.
