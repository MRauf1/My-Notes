# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Linear Approximation)[^1]
> For a [[Differentiable Function]] $f$, we can use the [[Tangent Line]] as an approximation of $f$ near [[Point]] $a$. The approximation function is
> $$
> \begin{align}
> L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)
> \end{align}
> $$
> It is also called tangent line approximation or linearization of $f$ at $a$.

> [!info] Definition 2 (Linear Approximation in Terms of [[Differential]])
> $$
> \begin{align}
> f(a + dx) \approx f(a) + dy
> \end{align}
> $$

This approximation's quality worsens as we get farther away from $a$.
