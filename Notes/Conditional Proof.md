# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Conditional Proof)[^1]
> With the conclusion $P \implies Q$, we can add on a CP [[Premise]] $P$. Once we derive $Q$, we can discharge the CP Premise $P$ by combining it with $Q$ to get $P \implies Q$.

Notes:
1) It can only be used to produce a conditional claim.
2) If using multiple CPs, they must be discharged in reverse order from that in which they were assumed (lines that run from different CP premises must not cross each other).
3) Once CP Premise has been discharged, no steps derived from it can be used in the following deduction.
4) All CP Premises must be discharged.
