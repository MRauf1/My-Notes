# Definition

Philosophy in which a balance between [[Deep Work]] and [[Shallow Work]] is kept. Some periods are dedicated solely to deep work, while the other periods are dedicated solely to shallow work.[^1]

This philosophy is better suited to those who, in addition to deep work, also need periods of shallow work.
