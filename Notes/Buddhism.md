Buddhist offered his teachings as a set of propositions one has to investigate themselves rather than a set of dogmas to be followed without question.

Buddhists believe humans are ultimately good, but their experience of that ultimate essence is hindered.

Buddhist divide thoughts into unskilled and skilled thoughts. Unskilled thoughts are ones related to greed, desire, hatred, delusion, and hinder one's progress towards liberation. Skillful thoughts are ones related to compassion, generosity, wisdom and help you progress forward. Skillful thoughts can also be used as temporary antidotes to the poison of unskillful thoughts. Once applied, use mindfulness to rip the layers of the unskillful thoughts so that the unskillful thoughts diminish and disappear.

Greed can be even something as subtle as wanting to be respected, be more perfect, be more virtuous. Even though not necessarily evil, they too distract us from the present.

The reality is impermanent. The desire for permanency in an impermanent universe causes pain and unhappiness. Need to realize and accept the impermanence of all things.
