# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 (Polynomial Upper and Lower Bounds)[^1]
> Suppose $f$ is a [[Polynomial Function|polynomial function]] with a [[Degree of Polynomial|degree]] $n \geq 1$
> - If $c > 0$ (from $(x - c)$) is [[Synthetic Division|synthetically divided]] into $f$ and all of the numbers in the final line of the division tableau have the same signs, then $c$ is an upper bound for the [[Real Number|real]] zeros of $f$
> - If $c < 0$ (from $(x - c)$) is [[Synthetic Division|synthetically divided]] into $f$ and all of the numbers in the final line of the division tableau have alternating signs, then $c$ is a lower bound for the [[Real Number|real]] zeros of $f$
> - NOTE: $0$ can be treated as either $(+)$ or $(-)$ in the final line of the division tableau
