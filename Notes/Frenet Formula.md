> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Frenet Frame Field]] [[Derivative]])[^1]
> For a Frenet Frame Field $T, N, B$ on [[Unit Speed Curve]] $\beta$, their derivatives are
> - $T' = \beta'' = \kappa N$
> - $N' = - \kappa T + \tau B$
> - $B' = - \tau N$
> If the [[Curve]] $\beta$ does not have unit speed, then the above becomes
> - $T' = \kappa v N$
> - $N' = - \kappa v T + \tau v B$
> - $B' = -\tau v N$
> where $v$ is the [[Curve Speed]] of $\beta$.
