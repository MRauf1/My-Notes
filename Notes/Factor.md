Factors of a [[Number|number]] $x$ are the numbers whose [[Multiplication|product]] equals $x$.[^1] When finding the factor pairs of a number, it is enough to go until the first number is greater than the second number, since the following factor pairs are just the previous ones, but reversed.[^2]

Factoring a number is the process of finding all of the factors of a number.

#TODO 

- Add in factoring polynomials
