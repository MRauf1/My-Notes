> Let $\alpha$ be a [[Smooth Curve]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f$ be a [[Real-Valued Function]] [[Smooth Function]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then

This represents the rate of change of $f$ along the [[Line]] through $\alpha(t)$ in the direction of $\alpha'(t)$. The right hand side represents the rate of change of $f$ restricted to the curve $\alpha$.
