# Definition

The median of a sorted dataset of $n$ datapoints is the middle value. When $n$ is odd, it is the singular middle value; when $n$ is even, it is the [[Mean|arithmetic mean]] of the two middle values.[^1]

> > [!example]- Example 1.1 (Median of Odd Numbered Dataset)
> > Median of $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$ is $3$
> 
> > [!example]- Example 1.2 (Median of Even Numbered Dataset)
> > Median of $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ is $\frac{3 + 4}{2} = 3.5$
