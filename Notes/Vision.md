# Definition

Human ability to see. According to [[David Marr|David Marr]], it is the ability to know what is where by looking. Additionally, vision is the process of discovering from images what is present in the world, and where it is.

[[Eyes|Eyes]] record [[Images|images]] through the [[Light|light]] that is directed towards the eyes (eyes only measure the intensity of light), and the [[Brain|brain]] extracts information about the world through the recorded images.[^1]

In other words, the eyes are the sensors that record relevant information in the form of images (input). Brain (agent) translates the input into the desired form (output) that tells information about the world and can solve relevant tasks, such as navigation, interaction with other agents, and etc...

However, vision is a dynamical system since as the longer one looks, the more they can see. It's not necessarily a static input-to-output function.[^2]

Most of the information is lost in the projection of the 3D world into 2D images, and as such, a number of assumptions must be made, which makes vision difficult.

It is the most powerful of human sensory abilities. Human body has about 11 million sensory receptors, of which roughly 10 million are dedicated to sight. Some scientists estimate that half of the brain's resources are used on vision.
