# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Finitely Generated [[Group]])
> A group $G$ is finitely generated if $G = <S>$ for some finite [[Subset]] $S \subseteq G$.

# Properties

## Finite Group
- Every finite group is finitely generated

## [[Group Isomorphism]]
- If $G \cong H$, then $G$ is finitely generated $\iff$ $H$ is finitely generated

## Other
- If $H$ is an [[Abelian Group]] and $N \trianglelefteq H$ where $N, H/N$ are finitely generated, then $H$ is finitely generated
