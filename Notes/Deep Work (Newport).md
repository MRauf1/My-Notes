# Review[^1]

Book by [[Cal Newport]] on the essence of [[Deep Work]].

Overall, not a transformative book, in my opinion. Most of the knowledge is stuff that I know, and the advice on deep work boils down to eliminating all distractions and deeply focusing on the work.

The first part of the book gives evidence as to why deep work is valuable, rare, and meaningful, which is neat and all, but overall, I already consider deep work to be important, so I really don't need any additional evidence. This part could have been summarized in a single small chapter, which would then immediately lead to the actual content of the book. I'd recommend people skipping the first part unless they are interested in the benefits of deep work.

I also don't agree with a 1-2 of his advices, although the rest of his points are pretty sound and valid. His points also might not be universally applicable to all kinds of workers. It is more appropriate to those who manage themselves rather than those who work under others.

Overall, I'd recommend a summary of the book rather than reading it all.
