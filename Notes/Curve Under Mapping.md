# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Curve]] Under [[Mapping]])[^1]
> If $\alpha: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is a [[Curve]] in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $F: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is a [[Mapping]], then the [[Function Composition]] $\beta = F(\alpha): I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is a [[Curve]] in $\mathbb{R}^m$ called the image of $\alpha$ under $F$.

#TODO 
Does the curve have to be smooth or not?
