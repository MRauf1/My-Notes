# Definition

To form a [[Habit]], make it satisfying.

1) In the short term, add immediate reward to a good habit. Add immediate punishment to a bad habit.
	1) In the long term, as a habit starts to become ingrained as an action that reinforces the desired identity, the habit starts to have an intrinsic reward since by promoting your desired identity makes you feel better.
	2) Incentives promote a habit, identity sustains a habit.
2) Track your habits visually.
	1) Ideally, track/mark the habit immediately after it's done.
	2) Never miss a habit twice in a row.
	3) Take note of [[Goodhart's Law]]. Measure is a tool; don't let it consume you.
3) Look for an accountability partner. It's painful/shameful to break promises to others.
