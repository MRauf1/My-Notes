# Review[^1]

A 400-page book about preparing and succeeding in college. A lot of the material are things that a basic college student should already know, so this is primarily intended for prospective college students. In particular, it is geared towards American universities, so it does not apply as generally to the rest of the world.

The book's content are pretty basic and trivial to me, as someone who is now a senior in college, and as such, I did not derive any significant value from the book.

Ultimately, the book is for prospective college students, so I might recommend it to them. But not as a full read-through, but rather selecting and skimming topics that the person feels unsure about. Alternatively, all of this knowledge can be gained through articles and googling, but this document presents a good outline of what a student should know.
