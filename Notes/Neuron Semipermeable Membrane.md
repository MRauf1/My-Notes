Semipermeable [[Membrane]] of a [[Neuron]] that allows [[Molecule]] that are small or neutral to pass through, while stopping molecules that are large or highly charged.[^1]

Surrounded by [[Extracellular Fluid]] and contains the [[Intracellular Fluid]]. The two fluids are electrically different and the membrane separates them. This difference in charge across the membrane ([[Membrane Potential]]) provides energy for the signal.
