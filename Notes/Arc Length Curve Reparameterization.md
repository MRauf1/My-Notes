# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 ([[Curve Arc Length|Arc Length]] [[Curve Reparameterization|Reparameterization]])[^1]
> If $\alpha$ is a [[Regular Curve]], then there exists a [[Curve Reparameterization]] $\beta$ of $\alpha$ such that $\beta$ is [[Unit Speed Curve]].
> The [[Curve Arc Length]] of $\beta$ from $s = a$ to $s = b$ is just $b - a$.

This reparameterization is [[Orientation Preserving Curve Reparameterization]].
