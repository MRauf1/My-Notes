# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Interior [[Point]])[^1]
> In a [[Metric Space]] $(S, d)$ and $E \subseteq S$, [[Point]] $e \in E$ is interior to $E$ if for some $r > 0$, $\{s \in S | d(s, e) < r\} \subseteq E$.

Point is interior in $E$ if the point is sufficiently close to other points in $E$.
