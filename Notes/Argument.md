# Definition

Provision of a set of reasons ([[Premise|premises]]) to support a [[Conclusion|conclusion]] and get closer to the truth (it's not about winning/losing and it doesn't use emotions and such like debates). The process of revision through dialectics is how arguments are generally advanced/improved.

Argument is valid if when the [[Premise|premises]] are all true, then the [[Conclusion|conclusion]] must also be true. This indicates a correct [[Deductive Reasoning|deductive reasoning]].[^1]
