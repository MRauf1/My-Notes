# Properties

## Subtraction Specific Properties

- [[Subtraction Property|Subtraction Property]]
- [[Subtraction Property of Equality|Subtraction Property of Equality]]


#TODO:

- For operations, maybe add a table which lists the names of each part, like divisor and dividend for division, their result, like difference, and the operation symbol.
- For subtraction property, may be add a separate callout for properties or something? Make it look better than this. Also add the properties to other operations.
