# Definition

Continuous storage of information.

Memories are organized in semantic/associative networks. Concepts are believed to be arranged hierarchically. Activating a part of the network also partially activates the concepts linked to it.

Different kinds of long-term memories are stored in different regions of the brain.

# Types
- [[Explicit Memory]]
- [[Implicit Memory]]
