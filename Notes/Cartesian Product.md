# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Cartesian Product)[^1]
> For two [[Set|sets]] $A, B$, their cartesian product is
> $$
> \begin{align}
> A \times B = \{(a, b) | a \in A \land b \in B\}
> \end{align}
> $$

The set of all [[Ordered Pair|ordered pairs]] where the first coordinate is the element of the first set and the second coordinate is the element of the second set.

> [!info] Definition 2 (Cartesian Product of $n$ Same Sets)
> For a set $A$, its $n$th cartesian product is
> $$
> \begin{align}
> A^n = \{(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) | a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \in A\}
> \end{align}

#TODO 
What about $(A x B) x C$, what would the result look like? ((a, b), c) or (a, b, c)?
