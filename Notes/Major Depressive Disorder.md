# Definition

Having a persistent depressive mood and loss of interest and pleasure in usual activities.[^1]

# Types
- [[Seasonal Depression]]
- [[Postpartum Depression]]
- [[Persistent Depression]]

# [[Brain]] Parts
Linked to abnormal activity in several regions of the [[Brain]], such as [[Amygdala]] and [[Prefrontal Cortex]].

## [[Amygdala]]
Depression shrinks [[Amygdala]], while at the same time, depressed people show elevated levels of activity of [[Amygdala]]

## [[Prefrontal Cortex]]
Depressed people exhibit less activation in the [[Prefrontal Cortex]], especially the left side

# [[Hormone]]
Depressed people have abnormally high levels of [[Cortisol]]. It's a question whether high levels of [[Cortisol]] are a cause or effect of depression.

# Causes
## Cognitive Theories
Triggered by negative thoughts, interpretations, self-evaluations, and expectations ("cognitive vulnerability"). Can stem from behavior exhibited by [[Learned Helplessness]]. Can also be a product of rumination.

## Genetic Component
Alteration of the [[5-HTTLPR Gene]] may be a culprit. More likely to experience depression if have one short version of the gene, and even more likely if have two short versions of the gene.
