# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 ([[Set Cardinality]] Bijectivity Theorem)
> For sets $A, B$, the following are equivalent
> - $|A| = |B|$
> - There exists a [[Bijective Function]] $f: A \rightarrow B$

> [!abstract] Theorem 2 ([[Set Cardinality]] Injectivity and Surjectivity Theorem)
> For [[Set]] $A, B$, the following are equivalent
> - $|A| \leq |B|$
> - There exists an [[Injective Function]] $f: A \rightarrow B$
> - There exists a [[Surjective Function]] $g: B \rightarrow A$
> If $|A| < |B|$, then the same holds true, but there might not be bijectivity.
