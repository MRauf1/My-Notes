# Definition

[[Subset|Subset]] of [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial intelligence]] that learns to make decisions by fitting mathematical/statistical models to observed data.[^1]

These models represents the family of [[Function|functions]] that map the inputs to their respective outputs. When fitting a model to the training data, the algorithm searches through the family to come up with the most accurate function given the data.

Learning is a bit different from [[Optimization|optimization]] since learning studies how to generalize the optimization on the training data to the test data. Thus, optimization on training data acts as a proxy for optimization on the test data.
