# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Covariant Derivative]] with Respect to [[Vector Field]])[^1]
> For a [[Vector Field]] $W$, its covariant derivative with respect to the [[Vector Field]] $V$ is the [[Vector Field]]
> $$
> \begin{align}
> \nabla_V W = \sum V[w_i] U_i
> \end{align}
> $$
> whose value at each [[Point]] $\mathbf{p}$ is $\nabla_{V(\mathbf{p})} W$.

# Properties
- [[Covariant Derivative Linearity]] with $V$ instead of $\mathbf{v}$
- [[Covariant Derivative Product Rule]] with $V$ instead of $\mathbf{v}$
