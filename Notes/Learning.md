# Definition

# Influencing Factors

- [[Spaced Repetition|Spaced Repetition]]
- [[Interleaving|Interleaving]]
- [[Practice|Practice]]
- [[Recall|Recall]]
- [[Mind Mapping|Mind Mapping]]
- [[Metaphor|Metaphor]]

# Types
- [[Associative Learning]]
- [[Classical Conditioning]]
- [[Operant Conditioning]]
- [[Observational Learning]]

## Hierarchy
- [[Bottom-up Learning|Bottom-up Learning]]
- [[Top-down Learning|Top-down Learning]]

For efficient learning, start with [[Bottom-up Learning|bottom-up learning]] to get a sense of the big idea of the material. This will start the rough formation of [[Chunk|chunks]] and create the necessary connections between them (where and how they fit in in all of this). Once done, begin [[Top-down Learning|top-down learning]] to strengthen each chunk.[^1]

#TODO 
- Some of these may be better off for memory instead of learning
