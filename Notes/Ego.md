# Definition

...

The false self created from the mental image of who we are; created from the unconscious identification with the mind. It is kept going through constant thinking.[^1]

# Time
Obsessed with the past (derives identity from it) and the future (must ensure its survival), and doesn't spend much time in the present. Furthermore, the present it sees is misperceived since it sees it with its biased eyes. Or it reduces the present to a means toward an end in the future.[^1]
