# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Invariant Factor Decomposition)
> Every finite [[Abelian Group]] $G$ is [[Group Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[Group]] of the form
> $$
> \begin{align}
> G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{a_1} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}_{a_k}
> \end{align}
> $$
> where $k \leq 0, a_1 \geq 2$, and $a_i | a_{i + 1}$.
> $a_1, \dots, a_k$ are the invariant factors.
> For a given $G$, the invariant factors are unique.

## Existence/Uniqueness Proof
It's quite involved. Refer to the Abstract Algebra lecture notes.
