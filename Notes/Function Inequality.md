> For functions $f, g$
> - The [[Solution|solutions]] to $f(x) = g(x)$ are the [[Set|set]] of all $x$ values for which the [[Graph|graphs]] of $f(x), g(x)$ intersect
> - The solutions to $f(x) < g(x)$ are the [[Set|set]] of all $x$ values for which the graph of $f(x)$ is below the graph of $g(x)$
> - The solutions to $f(x) > g(x)$ are the [[Set|set]] of all $x$ values for which the graph of $f(x)$ is above the graph of $g(x)$
