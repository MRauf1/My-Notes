# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 (Mean Value Theorem)[^1]
> Let $f$ be a [[Continuous Function]] on $[a, b]$ and [[Differentiable Function]] on $(a, b)$, then there is a number $c \in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$.

There is a number $c$ whose [[Tangent Line]]'s [[Slope]] is equal to the [[Slope]] of the [[Secant Line]] between $(b, f(b)), (a, f(a))$. Or in other words, the instantaneous rate of change equals the [[Average Rate of Change]] over the interval.

Generalization of [[Rolle's Theorem]].
