# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Quotient Group)
> For a [[Group]] $G$ with [[Normal Subgroup]] $N$, the quotient group is the [[Set]] of all [[Left Coset|left N-cosets]] in $G$ denoted as
> $$
> \begin{align}
> G / N := \{gN | g \in G\}
> \end{align}
> $$
> Quotient Group has a corresponding [[Quotient Function]].

The quotient group for the right $N$-cosets is the same since $N$ is normal.

#TODO 
- Add in info about equivalence classes and how it relates to this.
