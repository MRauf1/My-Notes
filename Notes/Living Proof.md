# Review

A book of experiences of various mathematicians and their struggles throughout their journey in mathematics. A short, but insightful read into the common struggles in learning mathematics, the social issues within mathematics, and other common issues.

The experiences of many bring forth the common theme that constant practice and dedication towards the field is what carries one forward and helps them succeed in the field.
