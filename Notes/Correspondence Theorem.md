# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 (Correspondence Theorem)
> For $N \trianglelefteq G$, construct [[Set]] $\mathbf{G} := \{A | N \subseteq A \leq G\}$ (the set of all [[Subgroup]] $A$ of $G$, which contain $N$) and set $\mathbf{N} = \{S | S \leq G/N\}$ (the set of all subgroups of $G/N$), then there is [[Bijective]] map $\phi: \mathbf{G} \rightarrow \mathbf{N}$ with $\phi(A) = A/N$.
