# Definition

...

Suffering is a desire to change your state (similar to boredom). It's what drives human progress.[^1]

According to [[Existentialism]] and [[Buddhism]], it is an inseparable part of life.

# Meaning in Suffering
If there is meaning in life, there is meaning in suffering.[^2]

# Little Comforts
People may tolerate the suffering through the little comforts, but these moments do not make the will to live unless they help the person make larger sense of his apparently senseless suffering.
