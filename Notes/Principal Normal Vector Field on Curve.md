> [!info] Definition 1 (Principal [[Normal Vector|Normal]] [[Vector Field on Curve]])[^1]
> Given a [[Curvature Vector Field on Curve]] $T'(s)$ on [[Curve]] $\beta$, the [[Unit Vector Field on Curve]] $N(s) = \frac{T'(s)}{\kappa}$ (where $\kappa$ is the [[Curvature Function on Curve]] with the restriction that $\kappa > 0$) on [[Curve]] $\beta$ is the principal normal vector field on $\beta$.

It tells the direction in which $\beta$ is turning at every [[Point]].
