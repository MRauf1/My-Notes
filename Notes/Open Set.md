# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Open Set)[^1]
> For a [[Metric Space]] $(S, d)$, [[Set]] $E^{\circ}$ is the [[Set]] of [[Interior Point]] in $E \subseteq S$.
> The [[Set]] $E$ is open in $S$ if every [[Point]] in $E$ is interior to $E$ ($E = E^{\circ}$).

Open set is a set that, with every point $e$ in it, contains all the points of the metric space that are sufficiently close to $e$.

[[Interval Notation|Open interval]] $(a, b)$ is an [[Open Set]]. The interior of $[a, b]$ is $(a, b)$.
