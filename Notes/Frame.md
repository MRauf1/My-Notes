# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Frame)[^1]
> A [[Set]] of $\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \mathbf{e}_3$ of three mutually [[Orthogonal Vector]] [[Unit Vector]] that are [[Tangent Vector]] to $\mathbb{R}^3$ at [[Point]] $\mathbf{p}$ is called a frame.

A frame can be thought of as an [[Orthonormal Basis]].

# Properties
- [[Attitude Matrix]]
