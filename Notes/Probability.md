# Definition

For [[Event|event]] $A$, the probability is the [[Real Number|real]]-valued [[Set Function|set function]] that outputs the chance of the event occurring and is denoted by $P(A)$.[^1] 

By definition, probability has the following properties:
- $P(A) \geq 0$
- $P(S) = 1$ for [[Universe of Discourse|outcome space]] $S$
- if $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ are [[Mutually Exclusive Events|mutually exclusive events]], then $P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \dots + P(A_n)$. This can be extended to an [[Infinity|infinite]], but [[Countably Infinite|countable]] number of events.

# Properties
- [[Probability of Complement]]
- [[Probability of Empty Set]]
- [[Probability of Subset]]
- [[Probability Maximum Value]]
- [[Probability of Set Union]]
