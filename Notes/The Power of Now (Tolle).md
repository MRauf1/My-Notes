# Review[^1]

Book by [[Eckhart Tolle]].

Lots of "guru"-like statements, like energy field this, energy charges, and such. Hard to take seriously. Believes that emotional pain is the main cause of physical pain and disease, which I disagree with. Quite a bit of repetition too. The text could be condensed and made shorter.

Has some *bold* claims, such as that being in the present can help slow down aging since increased consciousness makes the molecular structure less dense (what?). Claims this will make the immune system stronger too since the cells awaken and rejoice. Not just the physical immune system, but the psychic immune system too (what even is that?). I won't even mention his claims on menstrual flow because that was something else.

I like the format of Q&A present throughout the book. Answers questions that I have and some that I didn't think of. Does a good job of providing practical advice such as, focus on the present, be non-judgmental about your thoughts, and so on.

Overall, I liked his portrayal and the importance of the present moment and the disidentification from the mind. These topics were quite enlightening, but the rest of the text was quite spiritual and without substantial evidence (especially the second half), so I started losing interest in the text as it went on.

If you are going to read some of it, I'd recommend only reading Chapters 1, 3, 4 (verify?).
