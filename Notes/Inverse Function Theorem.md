# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 ([[Inverse Function]] Theorem)[^1]
> Let $F: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a [[Smooth Function]] [[Regular Mapping]]. Then there is an [[Open Set]] $U$ containing $\mathbf{p}$ such that $F$ restricted to $U$ is a [[Diffeomorphism]] of $U$ onto an [[Open Set]] $V$.
> $F$ is a [[Linear Isomorphism]] if and only if $F$ restricted to $U$ is a [[Diffeomorphism]].
