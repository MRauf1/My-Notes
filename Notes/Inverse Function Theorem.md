# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 ([[Inverse Function]] Theorem)[^1]
> Let $F: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a [[Smooth Function]] [[Regular Mapping]]. Then there is an [[Open Set]] $U$ containing $\mathbf{p}$ such that $F$ restricted to $U$ is a [[Diffeomorphism]] of $U$ onto an [[Open Set]] $V$.
> $F$ is a [[Linear Isomorphism]] if and only if $F$ restricted to $U$ is a [[Diffeomorphism]].

> [!abstract] Theorem 2 ([[Inverse Function]] Theorem)[^2]
> If a [[Differentiable Function]] $f$ is differentiable at [[Point]] $a$, its derivative is [[Continuous Function|continuous]] at $a$, and $f'(a) \neq 0$, then the [[Inverse Function]] $f^{-1}$ is differentiable at $b = f(c)$ with $(f^{-1})'(b) = \frac{1}{f'(a)}$.
