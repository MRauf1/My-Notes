Isomorphism is a [[Group Homomorphism]] that is [[Bijective]].

# Types
- [[Group Automorphism]]

# Properties

## Inverse
- $\phi: G \rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism $\implies$ $\phi^{-1}: H \rightarrow G$ is an isomorphism

## Theorems
- [[Group Isomorphism Theorem]]
- [[Diamond Group Isomorphism Theorem]]

## [[Abelian Group]]
- $G \cong H \implies (G$ is abelian $\iff H$ is abelian)

# Examples
- $D_3$ ([[Symmetry]] of [[Equilateral Triangle]]) and $S_3$ ([[Permutation]] of $\{1, 2, 3\}$)
- $(Z_4, +)$ ([[Set of Congruence Classes Modulo n]]), [[Symmetry]] of [[Rectangle]], $\Phi(5, \cdot)$, $\Phi(8, \cdot)$ ($\Phi$ being the [[Group of Modular Units]])

#TODO 
- Is the second example correct?
