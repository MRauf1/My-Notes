# Definition

[[Matrix|Matrix]] $A$ is in row echelon form (REF) if[^1]

1) Every row with nonzero entries is above every row with only zeros
2) First nonzero entry in each row is $1$
3) if $i < j$, then the first nonzero entry in $i$th row is strictly farther to the left than the first nonzero entry in the $j$th row

If $A$ is in REF, the first nonzero entry of each row is called a pivot.

> Every [[Linear System of Equations|linear system]] can be put in REF using [[Row Operations|row operations]].
