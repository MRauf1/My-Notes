# Behavior Change
3 layers of behavior change:[^1]

1) Changing your outcomes.
2) Changing your process.
3) Changing your [[Personal Identity]]/[[Personal Value]].

Identity-based change -> who we wish to become/who we are -> leads to a change in the [[Process]] -> leads to a change in the [[Goal]].

Ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit is a part of your identity. Only identity-based habits will stick forever. The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce your identity.

Focus on becoming the person you want to be, rather than the goal of accomplishing a specific thing.
