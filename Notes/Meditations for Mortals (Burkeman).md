# Review[^1]

Book by [[Oliver Burkeman]].

A lot of seems like repeat of his earlier book [[Four Thousand Weeks (Burkeman)]].

The chapters are very short and each one provides a relatively new idea in relation to the previous chapters. This makes the book very digestible and easy to go through.

Due to the shortness of the chapters though, none of the topics are discussed in deep detail, leaving one wanting a bit more of some of the concepts.
