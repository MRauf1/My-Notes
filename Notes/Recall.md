# Definition

The process of recalling previously studied information. This involves testing yourself rather than looking at solutions/rereading.[^1]

After reading a text, it is much more effective to recall the information than to reread or create [[Mind Mapping|mind maps]]. After all, recalling after reading helps to form and embed the initial [[Chunk|chunks]] in your brain.

To further enhance the effect, try recalling from different settings other than your place of study. Recalling in your place of study may make your brain biased to the cues within the place, hence why recalling from different settings can reduce the bias and make your information be independent of the setting.
