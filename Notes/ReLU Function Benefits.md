# Definition

- Stable as there are no [[Vanishing Gradients]]
- Efficient to compute
- Encourage [[Sparse]] representations
	- Neural network can focus on more relevant features by "turning off" the less relevant ones
	- Sparsity acts as [[Regularization]]
	- Sparse representations are more interpretable

#TODO 
Put the last subbullet points into the sparse note
