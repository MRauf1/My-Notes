# Definition

[[Hypothesis Test]] on [[Maximum Likelihood Estimation]] where the [[Null Hypothesis]] is $H_0: \beta = \beta_0$, which uses the [[Wald Test Statistic]].

It is a simple and relatively effective hypothesis test that works well when $n$ is large, but it performs poorly when $n$ is small. It is less accurate than [[Likelihood Ratio Test]] and [[Score Test]].

One downside is that the Wald test can be degenerate in that it produces a single value as its confidence interval rather than an actual interval.
