# Definition

Identically and Independently Distributed.

Identical trials means that the probability of success $p$ is the same for each trial.

Independent trials means that the $X_i$ are [[Independent Random Variable]].

Independence in here is a joint independence since all [[Marginal Distribution]] are independent.
