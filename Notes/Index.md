# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Index of Subgroup)
> Index of [[Subgroup]] $H \leq G$ is the number of [[Left Coset]]/[[Right Coset]], and is denoted as $[G : H] = \frac{|G|}{|H|}$

# Properties
- Index can be finite even if $H, G$ are [[Infinity|infinite]]

## Finite Index
For a [[Group]] $G$ with a [[Subgroup]] $H$
- $[G:H] = 1 \iff G = H$
- $[G:H] = 2 \implies H$ is a [[Normal Subgroup]]
