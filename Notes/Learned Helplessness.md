# Definition

In an experiment in 1960s by [[Martin Seligman]], one group of dogs was repeatedly shocked with no way to prevent it, while control group wasn't. When an opportunity to escape is present, the control group takes it, but the shocked group did not attempt to escape as they learned helplessness.[^1]

Might be a potential cause of [[Major Depressive Disorder]]. As a whole, attributions made for negative life events contribute to [[Major Depressive Disorder]]. It is true in particular for those who make internal (I'm not smart), global (Nothing can be done to change that), and stable (This is another example of how dumb I am) attributions for negative outcomes tend to develop symptoms for [[Major Depressive Disorder]]. However, attributions can be changed through practice and [[Cognitive Therapy]]/[[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]].
