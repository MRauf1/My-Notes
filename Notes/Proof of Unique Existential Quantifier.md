> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Proof|Proof]] of [[Unique Existential Quantifier|Unique Existential Quantifier]])[^1]
> For a [[Proposition|statement]] $\exists ! x P(x)$, to prove it
> 1) Existence: Prove $\exists x P(x)$
> 2) Uniqueness: Prove $\forall y (P(y) \implies y = x_0)$, where $x_0$ is the $x$ that is the solution to the Existence part

To prove a statement with the unique existential quantifier, one must show both the existence and the uniqueness of the solution.

Alternatively, one can use any of the other logical equivalent forms of the unique existential quantifier and prove using those.
