# Review[^1]

Book by [[Eckhart Tolle]] on spirituality.

Considered(?) a sequel to his previous book [[The Power of Now (Tolle)]]. It is an extension of that book, but as such, there is quite a bit of repetition between the two books. Most of the book also doesn't employ the Q&A approach that Tolle took in a decent portion of his earlier book.

Chapter 9 on Inner Purpose, in particular, was quite insightful and deserves a reread. It puts a lot of the actions that people strive for and goals into a new light.
