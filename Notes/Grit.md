# How to Get Grit
- Pursue what interests you
- Practice until you can do it, and then keep practicing
- Find a purpose in what you do
- Have hope in what you're doing
- Surround yourself with gritty people

# Applying Grit
Adopt an attitude that looks at the end goal as the only acceptable outcome. This grants acceptance that you may not succeed on the first attempt. Failure then is seen as part of the process that grants knowledge that moves you to success.
