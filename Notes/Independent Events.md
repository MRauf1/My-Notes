# Definition

> [!info] Definition
> Events $A, B$ are independent $\iff$

> \begin{align}

> Otherwise, they are called dependent events.

When the occurrence of one [[Event|event]] does not change the [[Probability|probability]] of the occurrence of the other event.[^1]

# Properties

- $P(A | B) = P(A)$, $P(B | A) = P(B)$
- $A, B$ are independent events $\implies$ 
	1) $A, B^c$ are independent
	2) $A^c, B$ are independent
	3) $A^c, B^c$ are independent
