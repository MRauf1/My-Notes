# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Mapping)[^1]
> [[Smooth Function]] $F: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is a mapping.
> This function $F$ can be completely described by $m$ real-valued functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($f_i: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$), or mathematically, $F(\mathbf{p}) = (f_1(\mathbf{p}), \dots, f_m(\mathbf{p}))$, where $f_i$ are the [[Coordinate Function]] of $F$. Also, $f_i = x_i(F)$, where $x_i$ are the [[Natural Coordinate Function]] of $\mathbb{R}^m$.
