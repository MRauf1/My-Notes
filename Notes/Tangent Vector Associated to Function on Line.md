> 1) Scalar-valued function:
> - If $f$ is a [[Real-Valued Function]] [[Smooth Function]], then $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $g(t) = f(\mathbf{p} + t \mathbf{v})$ is a smooth function on the line $r(t) = \mathbf{p} + t \mathbf{v}$ with the line [[Function]] being $r: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$.
> 2) Vector-valued function:
> - If $f$ is a [[Real Vector-Valued Function]] [[Smooth Function]], then $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ with $g(t) = f(\mathbf{p} + t \mathbf{v})$ is a smooth function on the line $r(t) = \mathbf{p} + t \mathbf{v}$ with the line [[Function]] being $r: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$.

The first case represents the value of $f$ as you move along the line defined by $r$. This produces a [[Smooth Curve]] on the [[Euclidean 2-Space]] where the x-axis is $t$ and y-axis is the resulting value.

The second case represents a new [[Smooth Curve]] traced out in $\mathbb{R}^m$ as you move along the line defined by $r$.
