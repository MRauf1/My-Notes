# Definition

One can use [[Backpropagation]] to optimize the input data. The result is the input data that minimizes the loss.

By defining the [[Loss Function]] as the negative of the neuron output, and then minimizing the loss until the input data, one can generate the input data that activates the neuron the most (maximize its output).[^1]
