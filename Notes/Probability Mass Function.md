# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Probability Mass Function)[^1]
> For a [[Discrete Random Variable|discrete RV]] $X$, its [[Probability|probability]] $P(X = x)$ denoted by $f(x)$ is the pmf of $X$.

# Properties

## Definitional Properties

These assume that $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and as such, $S = \text{support}(X)$.

1) $f(x) > 0, x \in S$
2) $\sum_{x \in S} f(x) = 1$
3) $P(X \in A) = \sum_{x \in A} f(x)$, where $A \subseteq S$
