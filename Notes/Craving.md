# Definition

The [[Motivation|motivational]] force towards a behavior in order to obtain the [[Reward]]. It is created from the desire to change your internal state.

Our behavior is heavily dependent on our interpretation of the events/cues that happen to us, not the objective reality of the events/cues. Same cue can result in widely different cravings in different people. Furthermore, what we desire is the *idea* of the reward - we do not fully know what the reward will be.
