# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Ellipse)[^1]
> Given two distinct [[Point]] $F_1, F_2$ and a fixed [[Distance]] $d$ (length of the major axis), an ellipse is the [[Set]] of all [[Point]] $(x, y)$ such that the sum of each of the distances from $F_1, F_2$ to $(x, y)$ is $d$.
> $F_1, F_2$ are the foci of the ellipse. Center of the ellipse is the [[Midpoint]] of the [[Line Segment]] connecting the two foci. Major axis of the ellipse is the [[Line Segment]] connecting two opposite ends of the ellipse which also contains the center and the foci. Minor axis of the ellipse is the [[Line Segment]] connecting two opposite ends of the ellipse which also contain the center but is perpendicular to the major axis. Vertices of the ellipse are the [[Point]] which lie on the major axis.

> [!info] Definition 2 (Equation of Ellipse)
> For positive unequal $a, b$, the ellipse with center $(h, k)$ is
> $$
> \begin{align}
> \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1
> \end{align}
> $$
> If $a > b$, then the major axis is horizontal and if $a < b$, then the major axis is vertical. $a, b$ are the distances from the center to the endpoints of the major/minor axes.
> Distance $c$ from the center to each focus is $c = \sqrt{|a^2 - b^2|}$

# Types
- [[Circle]] if $a = b$

# Properties
- [[Ellipse Eccentricity]]
