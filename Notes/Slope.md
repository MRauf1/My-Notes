The steepness of the [[Line|line]] (the higher $|m|$, the steeper the line).[^2] The vertical change is called the rise, and the horizontal change is called the run.[^3] If the line is rising upwards, it has a positive slope (the line is increasing); if the line is falling downwards, it has a negative slope (the line is decreasing). [[Vertical Line|Vertical line]]'s slope is undefined, and [[Horizontal Line|horizontal line]]'s slope is $0$.

The slope represents the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$.
