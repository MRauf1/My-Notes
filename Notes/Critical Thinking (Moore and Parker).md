# Review[^1]

A book on informal [[Logic]] by [[Noel Moore]] and [[Richard Parker]].

A somewhat long, but relatively dense book on the topic. It serves very well as an introduction as the material is very digestible and the language is very understandable.

The book contains material on all kinds of fallacies that plague critical thinking, and also delves into different types of reasoning, such as deduction and induction, with plenty of supporting material for each. In particular, deduction gets some sections on more formalized logic, though it only covers [[Propositional Logic]], not [[Predicate Logic]].

A decent chunk of the material may seem *obvious*, and as such, there are no groundbreaking new information that will change your perspective, but it is a good collection of all the things you need to know to properly think critically.
