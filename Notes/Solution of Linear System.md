# Definition

[[Solution|Solution]] for the [[Linear System of Equations|linear system]] is a [[Set|set]] of $c_1, c_2, ..., c_n \in \mathbb{F}$, such that when plugged in for the $x$ [[Variable|variables]], the [[Equation|equations]] hold true.

With each [[Linear Function|linear equation]]'s [[Solution|solutions]] being represented by a [[Line|line]], the solution(s) (if exists) of the system is the [[Intersection|intersection]] of all the lines.

A system of linear equations may have $1$ unique solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions.

# Existence of Solution

Solution(s) exists $\iff$
1) The [[Vector|vector]] $\mathbf{b}$ lies in $\langle \mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}, \dots, \mathbf{v_n} \rangle$ (the [[Span|span]] of the vectors $\mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}, \dots, \mathbf{v_n}$)[^2]

# Uniqueness of Solution

Solution is unique if it is the only solution. In other words, if whenever $c'_1, c'_2, ..., c'_n$ are also solutions, then $c_1 = c'_1, c_2 = c'_2, ..., c_n = c'_n$.[^1]
