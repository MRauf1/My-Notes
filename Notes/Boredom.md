Boredom is greatest threat to success/(danger in life), not failure. As habits become routine, we get bored of them, which reduces our motivation to keep doing them.
Can make use of variable rewards to stave off boredom, but ultimately, it'll only delay the boredom, not get rid of it completely. At the end of the day, one must learn to fall in love with the boredom.
