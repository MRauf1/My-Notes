# Review

A [[Psychology]] book by [[Carol Dweck]] about the [[Mindset]], and more specifically, the differences between the [[Fixed Mindset]] and [[Growth Mindset]], and how the two can significantly steer the trajectory of one's life.

The book is good and insightful. The author provides a plethora (and I really mean, plethora, because I've never seen this many examples in one book) of examples of each mindset and the effects they have on people. Some of these examples are anecdotal, but a lot of them are studies done by the author or other psychological researchers. These examples present strong evidence towards the author's claims.

While on one side, a strong point, on the other hand, the book is filled with too many examples. Usually, a section shortly describes one of the effects of one mindset, and then is followed by dozens (slight exaggeration) of examples showcasing this effect. Therefore, the main points make up a small part of the book, and as such, the book can be very easily condensed into just a few pages describing the mindsets, their effects, and how switch between them.

I also was not a fan of how long it took to get to how to switch to the growth mindset. The book early on showcased the strengths of the growth mindset and weaknesses of the fixed mindset, but kept on dragging on these points with a bunch of examples instead of explaining how to develop a growth mindset (especially since the description of it boosted my interest in this mindset, and I was eager to learn how to switch more to it). It dragged with mindset effects in various fields, like school, sciences, sports, businesses, relationships, which was insightful, but in reality, all of these were just different manifestations of the same principle, and as such, could have been presented as smaller examples rather than full-on chapters.

Overall, I enjoyed the book, but I'd recommend others to read the summary of the book and its main points to learn about the growth mindset rather than reading throughout the entire book. Unless they have enough spare time and want plenty of evidence to back the claims. In which, I'd recommend reading solely the first and the last chapters, where the first is presenting the growth mindset, while the last discusses how to switch to it.
