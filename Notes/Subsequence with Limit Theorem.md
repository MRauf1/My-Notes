# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 ([[Subsequence]] with [[Limit of Sequence]] Theorem)[^1]
> Let $(s_n)$ be a [[Sequence]]
> - If $t \in \mathbb{R}$, then there exists a subsequence of $(s_n)$ converging to $t$ if and only if the [[Set]] $\{n \in \mathbb{N} : |s_n - t| < \epsilon\}$ is infinite for all $\epsilon > 0$
> - If the sequence $(s_n)$ is [[Set Upper Bound|unbounded above]], it has a subsequence with limit $+\infty$.
> - If the sequence $(s_n)$ is [[Set Lower Bound|unbounded below]], it has a subsequence with limit $-\infty$.

In each case, the subsequence can be taken to be [[Monotone Sequence]].
