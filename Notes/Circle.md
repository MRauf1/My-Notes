# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Circle)[^2]
> Circle with center $(h, k)$ and radius $r > 0$ is the [[Set]] of all [[Point]] $(x, y)$ such that $d((x, y), (h, k)) = r$. The [[Equation]] is
> $$
> \begin{align}
> (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
> \end{align}
> $$

> [!info] Definition 2 (Circle [[Curve]] in $\mathbb{R}^2$)
> Circle of radius $a > 0$ centered at [[Point]] $\mathbf{p}$ is the [[Curve]] $\alpha: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ with $\alpha(t) = \mathbf{p} + a (cos(t), sin(t))$.

2D [[Shape|shape]] with no corners.

$r$ is the radius, which is the [[Distance|distance]] from the center of the circle to any [[Point|point]] on the circle. Alternatively, it is the [[Magnitude|magnitude]] of the [[Line Segment|line segment]] starting at the center of the circle and ending at one the points of the circle.

$d$ is the diameter, which is the magnitude of the line segment between two points on the circle such that the line segment passes through the center of the circle. $d = 2r$.[^1]

# Types
- [[Unit Circle]]

# Properties

## [[Perimeter|Circumference]]

$$C = 2 \pi r = \pi d$$

## [[Area|Area]]

$$A = \pi r^2$$

#TODO
- Maybe make the properties a table instead
- Add the properties to Anki too. Not just for this, but all notes.
