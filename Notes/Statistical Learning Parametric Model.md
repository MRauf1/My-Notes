# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Statistical Learning]] Parametric Model)[^1]
> Parametric models make assumptions about the form of the predictive function $f(X)$. This simplifies the process as now it is necessary to only fit the parameters instead of an arbitrary function.
> The assumption of the function form can lead to inaccuracies, so there's a trade-off between how flexible/complex the assumed model is. Higher flexibility can lead to better results, but also result in [[Overfitting]]. Lower flexibility, on the other hand, can result in [[Underfitting]].
