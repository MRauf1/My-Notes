# Definition

1) No one willingly chooses what is harmful to themselves.
2) When a person does harm to others, they harm themselves.

[[Socrates]] believes that all people desire to do good, and that people do evil out of ignorance.[^1]

The harm to themselves comes in the form of corruption of the soul, which is the greatest harm possible to a human.
