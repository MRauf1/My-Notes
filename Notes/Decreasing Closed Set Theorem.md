# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 (Decreasing [[Closed Set]] Theorem)[^1]
> Let $(F_n)$ be a [[Decreasing Sequence]] of [[Closed Set]] [[Bounded Set]] non-empty sets in $\mathbb{R}^k$ ($F_1 \supseteq F_2 \supseteq \dots$). Then $F = \cap_{n=1}^{\infty} F_n$ is also [[Closed Set]] [[Bounded Set]] and non-empty set.
