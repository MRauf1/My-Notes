> Given a [[Curvature Vector Field on Curve]] $T'(s)$, the curvature function on curve $\beta$ is $\kappa: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is

> Note that $\kappa \geq 0$, with the larger value indicating sharper turn. Additional restriction making $\kappa$ non-zero can be applied, in which case, the unit [[Vector Field on Curve]] $N(s) = \frac{T'(s)}{\kappa}$ on curve $\beta$ tells the direction in which $\beta$ is turning at each [[Point]].
