# Definition

[[Permutation]] form a [[Group]] with the [[Operation]] of [[Function Composition]]. The group with a [[Set]] of $n$ elements is denoted as $S_n$.[^1]

The group is also known as the [[Symmetric Group]].

# [[Subgroup]]
- [[Alternating Group]]

# Properties

## [[Group Order]]
- $|S_n| = n!$

## [[Group Element Order]]
- [[Permutation Order]]

## [[Cycle Type]]
- The number of possible cycle types is given by the [[Partition Function]] on $n$

## [[Normal Subgroup]]
- [[Subgroup]] $H \leq S_n$ is [[Normal Subgroup]] $\iff$ whenever $g \in H$, then so is every element with the same [[Cycle Type]] as $g$
