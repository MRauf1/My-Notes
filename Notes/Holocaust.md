# Survivors
Most of the ones who survived were the ones who used every means possible (honest or not) of surviving. The best of the prisoners did not survive.[^1]

## Phases
1) Shock
	1) Cold and detached curiosity predominated the prisoners as a means of protection for the mind.
	2) Thought of suicide was entertained by nearly everyone. In the first phase of shock, the prisoners didn't fear death.
	3) To survive, had to look fit for work. Shave daily even if need to use a broken piece of glass. Walk properly, even if injured.
	4) An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is a normal behavior.
2) Relative Apathy
	1) Have achieved an emotional death. All feeling were blunted, and could watch every atrocity unmoved.
	2) Spiritual life deepened among the hopelessness of it all.
	3) Nature became a lot more beautiful. Would wonder and look at it, even temporarily forgetting of one's own current circumstances.
	4) Suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind.
	5) Luck/Fate became the overarching force that controlled the prisoners' lives. Many accepted this fact and let fate take control and just went with the flow as there is no way to predict fate.
	6) Prisoners suffered from an inferiority complex. Since they were used to beatings and such, the impulse towards violence was increased.
3) Liberation
	1) Was hard to grasp that freedom was theirs for freedom has lost its meaning to the prisoners. Lack of feelings about their freedom and the new world. A sense of not belonging to the world. Had to relearn how to feel emotions -> all of this is described by "depersonalization". Everything appeared unreal to the victims.
	2) Some prisoners with more primitive kind of nature could not release them from the brutality of the camps. Thus, they in turn turned into the oppressors and began abusing others. They justified their behavior by their terrible experiences.
	3) Suffering didn't cease for some as they returned back home just to find out that no one was left waiting for them. All who they know are dead and their home is no longer the same.

# [[Personal Value]]
The concentration camp took everything from the prisoner. It threatened to take away the human's inner personal values too. If the prisoner did not make a stand to protect their values, they lost the feeling of being an individual, a being with a mind, a human with personal values. They descended to the level of an animal.

As [[Stoicism]] would say, can take everything from a human, but as long as the inner self is still alive, they have not been harmed.

# [[Fate]]/[[Free Will]]
Similar to [[Stoicism]] and modern [[Existentialism]] philosophy, the prisoners were only left with the ability to choose one's attitude in the given circumstances. No possessions, no freedom, nothing, but this. Some even forgotten themselves, their birthdays, names, and such. Those who found meaning proved man's capacity to rise above their outward fate.

The experiences of the prisoners show that humans do possess free will at least to some degree. Compare those who gave up and those who fought on to protect their values and rise above the apathy that was so predominant. Humans can preserve a vestige of their inner self and mind even under terrible conditions. Everything can be taken from a human except for one thing - the ability to choose one's attitude, one's way in any given set of circumstances. Even in those conditions, every day was filled with choices and decisions that determined your path, your very self. What mattered wasn't only the environment and the circumstances, one's inner self and choices also affected the outcome. The sort of person one became was also largely influenced by one's own decisions. It is this inner freedom, inner self, that makes life meaningful and purposeful. Whether the person strived to their personal values determined whether they were worthy of their suffering or not.
