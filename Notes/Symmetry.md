# Definition

Symmetry is an undetectable motion. An object is symmetric if it has symmetries.

$Sym(X)$ is the [[Set|set]] of [[Bijective Function]] from $X$ to $X$, which represents the "symmetries of $X$". $(Sym(X), \text{Function Composition})$ forms a [[Group|group]].[^2]

# Types

## Coordinate Plane Symmetries

For two [[Point|points]] $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$, they are

- Symmetric about the x-[[Axis|axis]] if
	- $x_1 = x_2 \land y_1 = -y_2$
- Symmetric about the y-axis if
	- $x_1 = -x_2 \land y_1 = y_2$
- Symmetric about the [[Origin|origin]] if
	- $x_1 = -x_2 \land y_1 = -y_2$

To test the symmetry of [[Graph|graphs]], plug in the above points into the [[Equation|equation]] of the graph, and if the equation holds true with the plugged in values, then the graph is symmetric.[^1]

## Function Symmetries

The graph of [[Function|function]] $f$ is 

- Symmetric about the y-[[Axis|axis]] ([[Even Function|even function]]) iff 
	- $f(-x) = f(x)$
- Symmetric about the [[Origin|origin]] ([[Odd Function|odd function]]) iff
	- $f(-x) = -f(x)$
