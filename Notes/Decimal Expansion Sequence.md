# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Decimal]] Expansion [[Sequence]])
> Every decimal $K.d_1d_2d_3\dots$ corresponds to the [[Sequence]]
> $$
> \begin{align}
> s_n = K + \frac{d_1}{10} + \dots + \frac{d_n}{10^n}
> \end{align}
> $$
> This [[Sequence]] is [[Bounded Sequence]] and [[Increasing Sequence]], so it converges.
