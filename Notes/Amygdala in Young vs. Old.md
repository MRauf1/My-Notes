# Definition

According to [[Laura Carstensen]]'s experiments, [[Amygdala]] of young people fired at both the positive and negative images, while for the old people, it only fired for the positive images.

The old people seemingly had rewired their brains to focus on the positive rather than the negative, which might explain why the older people are generally more happier than the younger ones.[^1]
