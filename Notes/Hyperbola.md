# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Hyperbola)[^1]
> Given two distinct [[Point]] $F_1, F_2$ and a fixed [[Distance]] $d$ (length of the transverse axis), a hyperbola is the [[Set]] of all [[Point]] $(x, y)$ such that the [[Absolute Value]] of the difference of each of the [[Distance]] from $F_1, F_2$ to $(x, y)$ is $d$.
> $F_1, F_2$ are the foci of the hyperbola. The two parts of the hyperbola are its branches. Center of hyperbola is the [[Midpoint]] of the [[Line Segment]] connecting the two foci. The transverse axis is the [[Line Segment]] connecting two opposite ends of the hyperbola which also contains the center and the foci. The conjugate axis is the [[Line Segment]] through the center which is [[Perpendicular Line]] to the transverse axis and has the same length as the [[Line Segment]] through the vertex that connects the two [[Asymptote]]. The vertices of the hyperbola are the [[Point]] which lie on the transverse axis. The asymptotes pass through the center.

> Distance from the center to the foci is $c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
> The [[Slant Asymptote]] slopes are $m = \pm \frac{b}{a}$
