# Definition

Percent is a [[Ratio|ratio]] with a denominator of 100. It is denoted using the percent symbol $\%$.[^1]


#TODO 

- is it a ratio or a fraction? should this go into fraction or separate or what?
- page 531 and 535, 536 for converting percents and decimals, and fractions
- add in the property of percent where 5% of 20 is the same as 20% of 5 (you can switch them)
- Include sales tax and commission problems, discount as examples here from pre algebra chapter 6.3
- Add a separate note for simple interest problems from pre algebra page 568. Or should I have a general note for interest problems? Maybe a general interest note with sub-notes of simple interest, compounding, and such.
