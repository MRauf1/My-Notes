This method is used to construct new curves from existing curves that follow the same route (but potentially different [[Curve Speed]] and/or different direction and/or travelling parts of the curve). Thus, $\beta$ represents a different trip over the route of $\alpha$. In other words, the traces of these two curves are the same.
