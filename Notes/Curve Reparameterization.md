This method is used to construct new curves from existing curves that follow the same route. Thus, $\beta$ represents a different trip over at least a part of the route of $\alpha$.

# Properties
## [[Velocity Vector]]
- [[Curve Reparameterization Velocity Vector]]

#TODO 
Is it over a part of the route or entire route? When is it entire, when is it part?
