# Definition

Reward satisfies the [[Craving]] and teaches you which actions are worth remembering in the future (formation of [[Habit]]). The reward then becomes associated with the [[Cue]].

Brain has more circuitry for wanting a reward (craving) rather than liking a reward.

The gap between the craving and the reward determines how satisfied you feel after the response. If it's positive, you are more likely to engage in this behavior. Less if negative. Satisfaction = Liking - Wanting. Thus, the more you want, the more dissatisfied you'll be.
