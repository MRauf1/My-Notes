# Definition

Showing a pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsive behavior that interferes with normal functioning.[^1]

# Causes
- Significant genetic component
	- At least two genes that are important in the regulation of [[Dopamine]]
- Environment has some influence (but genetics play a bigger role)
- Significant relationship between exposure to nicotine in cigarette smoke during the [[Prenatal Period]] and ADHD
	- Maternal smoking during pregnancy associated with more severe symptoms of ADHD

# [[Brain]] Parts
People with ADHD show less [[Dopamine]] activity in the regions of the [[Brain]] associated with [[Motivation]] and reward, such as the regions of the [[Frontal Lobe]]. In particular, people with ADHD have smaller [[Frontal Lobe]] and show less [[Frontal Lobe]] activation when performing mental tasks.
