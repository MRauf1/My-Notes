# Review[^1]

A beginner textbook for learning pre-algebra. It's a long textbook at over 1,000 pages, but each page is short with content (a lot of pictures and examples), so in reality, the book is an easy read. It does a pretty decent job explaining the material and an okay job at giving an intuition for the different operations. Great for a beginner or to renew your previous knowledge.
