# Definition

[[Point|Point]] at which a [[Line|line]] and one of the [[Axis|axes]] intersect.[^1]

Intersection with the $x$-axis is called the $x$-intercept. The intercept is the point $(a, 0)$ in [[2D Space|2D]]. To find the $x$-intercept, set the other [[Variable|variables]] to $0$ and solve for $x$.

Likewise, there can also be a $y$-intercept, $z$-intercept, and so on.
