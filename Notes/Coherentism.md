# Definition

View that justification is structured like a [[Graph]], and as such, a belief is justified if it is embedded in a graph of coherent, mutually supported beliefs.[^1]

The idea comes from the observation that when justifying one's beliefs, one looks not just at "foundational beliefs", but at how this belief meshes with the other related beliefs, which are not necessarily foundational.

# Problems
It can result in circularity, meaning that a single belief may have a roundabout role in justifying itself (think of a [[Cycle]] in a graph).
