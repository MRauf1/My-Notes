# Definition

Theory of [[Vision|vision]] (425 BC) that believed that objects make copies of themselves (eidola or simulacra) that entered [[Eyes|eyes]].[^1]

Defined by Greek philosophers [[Demokritos|Demokritos]], [[Epicurus|Epicurus]], and [[Lucretius|Lucretius]].

Unclear how copies are made, distributed to different observers, how the copies fit into eyes.
