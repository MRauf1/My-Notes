# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Sequence)[^1]
> Sequence is a [[Function]] with the [[Domain]] $\{n \in \mathbb{Z} | n \geq m\}$. $n$th index of the sequence is denoted as $s_n$ and the sequence itself is denoted as $(s_n)_{n = m}^{\infty} = (s_m, s_{m + 1}, \dots)$.

Unlike [[Set]], sequence is ordered and can have repeating elements.
