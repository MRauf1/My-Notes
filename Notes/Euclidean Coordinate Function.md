# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Euclidean Coordinate [[Function]])[^1]
> If $V$ is a [[Vector Field]] on $\mathbb{R}^3$, there are $3$ uniquely determined real-valued functions $v_1, v_2, v_3$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ ($v_i: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$) such that
> $$
> \begin{align}
> V = v_1 U_1 + v_2 U_2 + v_3 U_3
> \end{align}
> $$
> where $U_1, U_2, U_3$ are the vector fields of the [[Natural Frame Field]]. The functions $v_1, v_2, v_3$ are called the Euclidean Coordinate Functions.
> Thus, every [[Tangent Vector]] can be expressed as $[a_1, a_2, a_3]_{\mathbf{p}} = \sum_{i} a_i U_i(\mathbf{p})$.

Euclidean coordinate functions are [[Function]] that define coordinates in a [[Euclidean Space]].

#TODO 
Sometimes these are on R^3, sometimes are on R. Why and when do they switch?
