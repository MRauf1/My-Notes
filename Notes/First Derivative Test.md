> Suppose $c$ is a [[Critical Number]] of a [[Continuous Function]] $f$
> - If $f'$ changes from positive to negative at $c$, then $f$ has [[Local Maximum]] at $c$
> - If $f'$ changes from negative to positive at $c$, then $f$ has [[Local Minimum]] at $c$
> - Otherwise, $f$ has no [[Local Minimum]] or [[Local Maximum]] at $c$
