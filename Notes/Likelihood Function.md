# Definition

Given data, for a chosen [[Probability Distribution]], the likelihood function is the probability of the data as a [[Function]] of an unknown parameter.

For an unknown parameter $\beta$, the likelihood function is denoted as $l(\beta)$.

The part of the likelihood function involving the parameters is called the kernel.[^1]
