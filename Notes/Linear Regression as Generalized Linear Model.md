# Definition

To get [[Linear Regression]] from [[Generalized Linear Model]],
1) $Y \sim Normal(\mu, \sigma^2)$ where the [[Variance]] is constant.
2) $\eta = X\beta$
3) $g(\mu) = \mu$ ([[Linear Function]])

In addition to [[Generalized Linear Model Assumptions]], [[Linear Regression]] adds an assumption that the errors/residuals are [[Normal Distribution|normally distributed]] with [[Expectation]] of $0$ and a constant [[Variance]] and that they're [[Independent Random Variable]].
