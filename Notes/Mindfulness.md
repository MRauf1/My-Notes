# Definition

Mindfulness is non-judgmental observation. It accepts everything as equal. All thoughts, feelings, emotions, experiences. Nothing is suppressed or repressed. It is independent of the mental/emotional state.

When you first become aware of something, there is a fleeting instant of pure awareness before the mind conceptualize that thing. That pure awareness without the medium of thought is mindfulness.

Fully developed mindfulness is a state of total non-attachment and utter absence of clinging to anything in the world. The result is an invulnerable mind that is unaffected by the ups and downs of life.

Mindfulness requires energy and effort, but it requires gentle effort.

# [[Self]]
There is no "me" in pure awareness/mindfulness.

# [[Vipassana Meditation]]
Within [[Vipassana Meditation]], it is both an end and a means to an end.

# Growth
Mindfulness, like muscle, grows through exercising it.

If mindfulness is to grow, one must accept what they find through mindfulness.
