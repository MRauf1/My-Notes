# Definition

Pieces of information bound together through a shared meaning/use/context. Neuroscientifically, it is a network of [[Neuron|neurons]] that are fired together.[^1]

# Formation

Need to be in [[Focused Mode|focused mode]] in order to start forming a chunk.

Start with a small chunk by getting an initial sense of the pattern present or an understanding of the basic concept. As the patterns between related mini-chunks come out, connect the mini-chunks into bigger chunks. Through repeated practice and additional related information, chunks can become stronger and grow bigger. Test yourself by actually doing the task yourself to build mastery. 

Gather the context of the chunks to see when and how the chunks/techniques should be used. Do so by practice both related and unrelated problems (e.g. for proofs, test what would happen if one of the conditions is removed). This will help seeing each chunk's role and place in the bigger picture. Focus more on the connections between chunks/steps rather than the individual chunks/steps.

[[Stress|Stress]] can negatively impact the [[Brain|brain's]] ability to form chunks and make connections.
