# Definition

[[Plato]]'s account of knowledge.

Person S knows [[Proposition]] P if and only if
1) P is true
2) S believes P
3) S is justified in believing P

This account was generally accepted until 20th century, but there are now cases in which it fails. These cases are known as the [[Gettier Case]].

There have been attempts to fix this account, but no universally accepted account has been invented yet.
