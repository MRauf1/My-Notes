# Definition

Meditation is a process of self-discovery. It helps to overcome misconceptions about oneself and reality in general. It is an activity that brings about a transformation of personal perspective and helps to "purify" the mind. It brings up all of oneself, be it positive or negative, and helps one to accept themselves rather than hiding or running away from certain undesirable qualities.

Meditation is an experiential activity that must be experienced to be understood, not told about.[^1]

# Effects
It is important to use meditation not as a means to an end, but as an end itself. Don't expect or desire anything from meditation for such desire will hinder one's progress. Just treat as an introspective activity that is worth doing regardless of its benefits.

It must be done consistently in order to see the effects.

## Benefits

Though meditation may have some benefits within a short period of start, most of the benefits won't be experienced without a substantial amount of practice. Therefore, discipline, consistency, and patience are key to meditation.

### Pain
Meditation helps you learn how to deal with pain, which is ultimately inevitable, even if it can be minimized.

### Daily Life
To make full use of meditation, don't just meditate, but also apply the insights learned from it toward everyday life. One can also meditate throughout their day, in activities, such as walking, sitting, and such. Every spare moment can be turned into a practice of meditation. Investigate and calmly observe everything in everyday life. Keep your mind open at all times.

# Failure
There is no failure in meditation unless you give up entirely. There are only setbacks and difficulties, which should be viewed as positive, since they are opportunities for improvement.

# Meditators
Advanced meditators are typically easy-going people who have a sense of humor and who can laugh at their own failures.
