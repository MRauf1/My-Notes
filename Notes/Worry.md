# Tips

- As a temporary remedy, keep yourself busy so that you have no time to think about your worries.
- Think about how statistically unlikely the worry is.
- Accept the inevitable. Acceptance is the first key step towards flourishing.
- Use the past to learn from your mistakes and carry on. Don't dwell on the past.

## Addressing Worry
- Get all the facts in an impartial/objective manner.
- Analyze/interpret the facts. Make sure to write this down, and not just think this in the mind.
- Come to a decision and act on it in a calm manner.

## [[Present]]
- Live in the present, not past or future.
- Do not think of time in the abstract. Do not think of it as an expendable resource. Time and life are inexplicably intertwined. Do not separate them.
- You have no control over time. Do not try to dominate it. Let it flow naturally.

## Limits of Human Life
- Accept the limits of the human life.
- Accept that you have no control over life.
- Accept that the "best" life you keep envisioning won't come to pass. And that's okay. Do things because they are worth doing for you.
- Make the burden so overwhelming that you have no choice but to put it down.

### Will Feel Better Once Tasks are Done
- Remember [[Parkinson's Law]].
- Even if tasks are done, new ones will always come up.
- Stop depending on completion of tasks for a peace of mind. Accept the reality and the limits of humanity.

## Worst Case Scenario
1) Think about what the worst case scenario is.
2) Accept the worst case scenario.
3) Proceed to improve upon the worst.
