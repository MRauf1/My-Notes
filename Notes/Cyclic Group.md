# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Cyclic Group)
> [[Group]] $G$ is cyclic if $G = <a>$ for some generator $a \in G$

# Properties

## Theorems
- [[Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups]]

## [[Finitely Generated Group]]
- Every cyclic group is finitely generated

## Prime [[Group Order]]
- $|G| = p$, where $p$ is a [[Prime Number]] $\implies$ that $G$ is cyclic

#TODO 
- Is the intuition for 4th property true? Is it exactly one of each divisor? But the number of divisor is less than the order of the cyclic group, so what about the rest? Are they all generators?
