# Definition

Triangle is a 2D [[Shape|shape]] with $3$ sides and $3$ [[Angle|angles]]. It is named by its vertices (triangle with vertices $A, B, C$ is $\Delta ABC$ (Triangle $ABC$)). Its sides are named with the lowercase letters of the vertex opposite to them. The length of the sides though may be referred by the endpoints (length of $a$ is $BC$).[^1][^2]

# Types

- [[Right Triangle|Right Triangle]]
- [[Isosceles Triangle|Isosceles Triangle]]
- [[Equilateral Triangle|Equilateral Triangle]]

# Properties

- [[Sum of the Measures of the Angles of a Triangle|Sum of the Measures of the Angles of a Triangle]]
- [[Similar Triangles|Similar Triangles]]
- [[Congruent Triangles|Congruent Triangles]]

## [[Perimeter|Perimeter]]

$$P = a + b + c$$

## [[Area|Area]]

$$A = \frac{1}{2} b h$$

where $b$ is the base, and $h$ is the length of the line that connects the base to the opposite vertex at a [[Right Angle|right angle]] with the base.

#TODO 
- Why does this area formula work for all triangles, not just right triangles?
