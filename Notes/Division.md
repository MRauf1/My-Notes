The [[Operation|operation]] of repeated [[Subtraction|subtraction]]. The number being divided is the *dividend*, the number dividing is the *divisor*, the result is the *quotient*, and the operation symbol is $\div$. Division can be expressed as a [[Fraction|fraction]].[^1]

- For $a, d \in \mathbb{Z}, d \geq 1, \exists ! q, r \in \mathbb{Z}, a = qd + r$, with $0 \leq r < d$[^2]

#TODO

For aliases, should I include subparts, like dividend and divisor?
Make the properties look better
