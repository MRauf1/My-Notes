# Definition

[[Expression]] obtained by adding/multiplying real-valued [[Function]] and the [[Differential]] of the [[Natural Coordinate Function]] of $\mathbb{R}^n$.[^1]

Extension of [[1-Form]]. If each summand has $p$ $dx_i$'s, then it is a $p$-form and is said to have degree $p$. In particular, $0$-form is just the [[Smooth Function]] $f$.

The multiplication of differential forms is denoted by the wedge product $\land$. In general, the product of a $p$-form and a $q$-form is a $(p + q)$-form.
