> [!info] Definition 1 (Attitute [[Matrix]])[^1]
> Given a [[Frame]] $\mathbf{e}_1 = [a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}], \mathbf{e}_2  = [a_{21}, a_{22}, a_{23}], \mathbf{e}_3 = [a_{31}, a_{32}, a_{33}]$ at a [[Point]] $\mathbf{p}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the attitude matrix is the $3 \times 3$ [[Matrix]] whose rows are the [[Euclidean Coordinate Function]] of these three [[Vector]].
> The attitude matrix is an [[Orthogonal Matrix]].
