# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 ([[Infinite Series]] Root Test)[^1]
> Let $\sum a_n$ be [[Infinite Series]] and let $\alpha = \lim \sup |a_n|^{1/n}$.
> 1) It is [[Absolutely Convergent Infinite Series]] if $\alpha < 1$
> 2) It diverges if $\alpha > 1$
> 3) Otherwise $\alpha = 1$, and the test gives no information

Better test than the [[Infinite Series Ratio Test]] in that, if the root test gives no information, then the ratio test won't give information either. But the converse is not generally true.
