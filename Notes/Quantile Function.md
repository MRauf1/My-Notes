> [!info] Definition 1 (Quantile [[Function]])[^1]
> For a [[Random Variable]] $X$, its $\tau$ quantile is the quantile function $Q(\tau)$ that is the solution to the following equation
> $$
> \begin{align}
> P(X \leq Q(\tau)) = F(Q(\tau)) = \tau
> \end{align}
> $$
> $Q(\tau)$ is the [[Inverse Function]] of the [[Cumulative Function]] $F(x)$
> $$
> \begin{align}
> Q(\tau) = F^{-1}(\tau)
> \end{align}
