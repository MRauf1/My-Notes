# Definition

Philosophy founded by [[Mozi]] that came about after [[Confucianism]] and that is critical of [[Confucianism]].[^1]

It emphasizes the equality of all people, regardless of their status. It argued that the non-equality between people is what led to greed and war. This leads to the belief of universal love and the opposition of aggression and war.

It is a form of [[Consequentialism]] as it values actions that bring the greatest overall benefit.
