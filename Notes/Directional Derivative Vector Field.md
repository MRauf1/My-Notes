# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Directional Derivative]] [[Vector Field]])[^1]
> Let $f$ be a [[Smooth Function|smooth]] real-valued [[Function]] on $\mathbb{R}^3$. Applying the vector field $V$ on it, we get
> $$
> \begin{align}
> V[f](\mathbf{p})
> \end{align}
> $$
> where at each [[Point]] $\mathbf{p}$, $V[f](\mathbf{p})$ gives the [[Directional Derivative]] with respect to the [[Tangent Vector]] $V(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{v}_{\mathbf{p}}$ at point $\mathbf{p}$.

Extension of the [[Directional Derivative]] from [[Tangent Vector]] to [[Vector Field]].
