# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Random Variable)[^1]
> Given a [[Random Experiment|random experiment]] with an [[Universe of Discourse|outcome space]] $S$, the random variable is the [[Function|function]] $X: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that assigns a [[Real Number|real number]] $X(s) = x$ for each $s \in S$.
> The space/support of $X$ is the [[Image|image]] of the function $X$, i.e. it is the [[Set|set]] $\{x \in \mathbb{R} | X(s) = x, \forall s \in S\}$.

Random variable is a ([[Deterministic|deterministic]]) function that enumerates the outcomes of a random experiment (maps the outcomes of a random experiment to real numbers).

Empirically, for a [[Random Experiment|random experiment]] carried out $n$ times, the expectation is that the [[Probability|probability]] of an [[Event|event]] $A$ occurring should be close to the [[Relative Frequency|relative frequency]] of the event $A$.
