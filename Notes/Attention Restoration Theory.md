# Definition

In a 2008 study in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the researchers found that the group spending time outside in the nature did $20\%$ better compared to the control group on a concentration-sapping task.[^1]

Cognitively-challenging tasks require [[Directed Attention]], which is finite and not easily replenished. Activities that provide "inherently fascinating stimuli", such as walking through nature, allow the attention to replenish.
