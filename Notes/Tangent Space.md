# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Tangent]] [[Space]])[^1]
> Let $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ be a [[Point]]. The [[Set]] $T_{\mathbf{p}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ consisting of all [[Tangent Vector]] that have point $\mathbf{p}$ as their point of application is called the tangent space of $\mathbb{R}^3$ at $\mathbf{p}$.
> With [[Operation]] of [[Vector Addition]] and [[Vector Scalar Multiplication]], the tangent space is a [[Vector Space]].

# Properties

## [[Linear Isomorphism]]
- [[Tangent Space Linear Isomorphism]]
