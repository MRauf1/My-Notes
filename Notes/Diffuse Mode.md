# Definition

[[Modes of Thinking|Mode of thinking]] which allows one to look at things broadly from a big-picture perspective.[^1] It is sometimes performed by the unconscious mind, which is why breaks and other unrelated activities can help facilitate this mode of thinking.[^2]

Due to the broadness, there is a lack of focus or understanding of finest concepts of a topic, but it allows one to escape the preestablished [[Thought Pattern|thought patterns]] and to establish new neural connections and thought patterns. Thus, it is useful for learning new material.

The source uses a pinball analogy to explain this concept.

#TODO
