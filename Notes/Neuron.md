# Definition

They are interconnected information processors essential for the tasks of the nervous system.[^1]

Signals from other neurons come in from the [[Dendrite]], travel through [[Soma]] and down the [[Axon]] towards the [[Terminal Button]], where the [[Synaptic Vesicle]] release [[Neurotransmitter]] into the [[Synaptic Cleft]], at which point, they travel across it and bind with corresponding [[Receptor]] on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron.

Between signals, it is held in a state of readiness, known as the [[Resting Potential]]. In this state, [[Sodium]] (Na$^+$) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will move into the cell. [[Potassium]] (K$^+$}) is more concentrated inside the cell and will move out the cell. This [[Sodium-Potassium Pump]] transports $3$ sodium [[Ion]] out of the cell for every $2$ potassium ions, creating a net negative charge in the cell.

When the cell receives signal, small gates open on the membrane, allowing sodium ions into the cell, creating a more positive charge in the cell. If the charge reaches the [[Threshold of Excitation]], the neuron activates and the [[Action Potential]] begins.

At the peak of the spike, the gates for sodium ions close, and the gates for potassium ions open, and the cell begins [[Repolarization]] as the charge becomes more negative again.

Once the signal is delivered, excess [[Neurotransmitter]] in the [[Synaptic Cleft]] drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are reabsorbed by the neuron ([[Reuptake]]) in order to clear the synapse.
