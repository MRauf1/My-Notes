# Definition

Mathematical phrase involving [[Number|numbers]] ([[Constant|constants]] and [[Variable|variables]]) and [[Operation|operations]]. [^1]

> [!example]- Examples 1 (Expression)
> > [!example]- Example 1.1 (Basic Expression)
> > $$
> > \begin{align}
> > x + 2 - y
> > \end{align}
> > $$

#TODO

- Mention the difference between expression and equation/inequality/relational statement/statement in general? (how one is like a phrase, while the other is like a sentence).
- Math statement isn't the best. Perhaps express it differently. Like, expression is a combination of variables, constants, and operations.
