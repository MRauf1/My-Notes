# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Vector Field]] on [[Curve]])[^1]
> [[Vector Field]] $V$ on [[Curve]] $\alpha: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ is the [[Function]] $V: I \rightarrow T_{\alpha(t)}(\mathbb{R}^3)$.
> It can be written as $V = \sum v_i(t) U_i(\alpha(t))$, where $v_i$ are the [[Euclidean Coordinate Function]] of $V$. The derivative is then $V' = \sum v_i'(t) U_i(\alpha(t))$.
