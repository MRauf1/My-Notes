# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 (Descartes' Rule of Signs)[^1]
> Suppose $f$ is a [[Polynomial Function|polynomial function]] written in the order of descending [[Exponentiation|powers]] of $x$. The number of variations of sign is defined as the number of times the signs of the [[Coefficient|coefficients]] of $f$ change.
> - If $P$ is the number of variations of sign of $f(x)$, then the number of positive [[Real Number|real]] zeros (including [[Multiplicity|multiplicity]]) is in the [[Set|set]] $\{P, P - 2, P - 4, \dots\}$
> - If $N$ is the number of variations of sign of $f(-x)$, then the number of negative [[Real Number|real]] zeros (including [[Multiplicity|multiplicity]]) is in the [[Set|set]] $\{N, N - 2, N - 4, \dots\}$
