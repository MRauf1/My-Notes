# Review[^1]

Book by [[Dale Carnegie]] on [[Social Skill]].

A great and relatively short (compared to other self-help books) book. The advice is credible and effective. To some (especially experts in social skills), it may seem trivial advice, but to me, it was quite enlightening.

The critical points themselves can be summarized with a list of bullet points. The anecdotal evidences presented in each section is helpful to better understand the point, although I feel like a couple of examples should be enough to get the idea, but each section consists 90% of various examples, some of which sound repetitive.

The points themselves are mostly distinct, although there are a few repetitions, and some distinct points can be generalized with a unifying point instead.

Highly recommend to anyone who feels like they are socially inept or lacking.
