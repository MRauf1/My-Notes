# Types

- [[Common Multiple|Common Multiple]]
- [[Least Common Multiple|Least Common Multiple]]
- [[Least Common Denominator|Least Common Denominator]]

#TODO

- Provide a more formal definition when you get to number theory/discrete math.
- What about negative numbers? What about 0?
- Add ways of determining common multiples (like multiples of 10 have a zero at the end, multiples of 2 are even, multiples of 3 -> the sum of their digits is divisible by 3, and so on)
