# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 (Chinese [[Remainder Function|Remainder]] Theorem)
> If $m = ab$ with $a, b \geq 1$ and $a, b$ are [[Relatively Prime]], then for any $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}$, there exists $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $x \equiv \alpha\ (\text{mod}\ a)$ and $x \equiv \beta\ (\text{mod}\ b)$. Furthermore, any two such $x$ are congruent modulo $m$.
> Alternatively, it also implies that $\mathbb{Z}_m \cong \mathbb{Z}_a \times \mathbb{Z}_b$ with $\phi([x]_m) = ([x]_a, [x]_b)$

This can be generalized to more than 2 numbers.
