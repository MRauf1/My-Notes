# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 ([[Mean Value Theorem]] for [[Integral]])[^1]
> If $f$ is [[Continuous Function]] on $[a, b]$, then there exists a number $c \in [a, b]$ such that $f(c) = f_{ave} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) dx$

There exists a number $c$ which has the value equal to the average on the interval $[a, b]$.

Geometrically, there exists a rectangle with base $[a, b]$ and height $f(c)$ that has the same area as the region under the graph of $f$ in the interval $[a, b]$.
