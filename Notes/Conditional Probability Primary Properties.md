- $P(A | B) \geq 0$
- $P(B | B) = 1$
- if $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ are [[Mutually Exclusive Events|mutually exclusive events]], then $P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_n | B) = P(A_1 | B) + P(A_2 | B) + \dots + P(A_n | B)$. This can be extended to an [[Infinity|infinite]], but [[Countably Infinite|countable]] number of events.
