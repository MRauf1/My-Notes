# Definition

Measure of the [[Surface|surface]] that is covered by a [[Shape|shape]]. It is measured in square units.[^1]

#TODO

- Surface vs shape
- Add a table for areas of different shapes
- Provide my own intuitive explanation, of how area is just the perimeter added up by the new dimension. This can be applied to perimeter (point added over a line), area (a line (more like line segment) added over a line), volume (plane (it's not a complete plane though) added over a line).
- Unrelated, but a note for the coordinate system with the number line, or will that be after the graph chapter?
- For now, only doing section exercises, and saving the chapter review exercises and the practice test, and the initial try it for later. Maybe add in a number line for equality and inequality too.
- Add a note for length and properly link it everywhere. Use the linear measure info from page 774 of pre-algebra.
