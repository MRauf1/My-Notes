# Definition

To form a [[Habit]], make it easy.

1) Reject perfectionism - focus on repetition/action, even if it is not perfect. Don't be afraid of failure. Failure is what will perfect your art.
2) Reduce friction for the habit within the environment. Increase friction for undesired habits.
	1) Automate the habit using technology.
3) When starting a habit or adding a step to a habit, have it be less than 2 minutes long/focus on the first 2 minutes. Taking the first small step will make the continuation easier too. Even a small step reinforces your desired identity.
4) Change the habit so that it takes more effort to get out of the good habit than to start it (e.g. schedule a running session with friends).
