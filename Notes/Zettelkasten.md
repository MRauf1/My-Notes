# Definition

Slip-box system for note-taking and connecting/generating ideas developed by [[Niklas Luhmann]].

Links between notes are what give rise to new ideas and connections between ideas.

Each note should contain only one idea, and is therefore, usually short and concise.

In a sense, Zettelkasten is an extension of one's thinking. A system that promotes research and discovery of new ideas.

# Types of Notes

1) Fleeting Notes
2) Literature Notes
3) Permanent Notes

# Zettelkasten vs. Wikipedia
Unlike Wikipedia-type system that is used for recording information, Zettelkasten is about recording ideas, making connections, and generating new ones.[^1] Although in practice, the two are not all that different, and one could repurpose a Wikipedia-type system to work like a Zettelkasten.

They do both possess similarities though, such as the idea of linking notes. However, they also differ: in Zettelkasten, a note represents a single idea, which is not necessarily the case in Wikipedia.
