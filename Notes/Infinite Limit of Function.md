> Let $f$ be a [[Function]] defined on some [[Interval Notation|open interval]] that contains the number $a$, except possibly at $a$ itself. Then $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = \infty$ if for every number $M > 0$, there exists a number $\delta > 0$ such that

> We say that the limit does not exist and diverges to infinity.
