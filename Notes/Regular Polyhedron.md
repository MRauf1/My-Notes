# Properties

## [[Permutation]]
- For a [[Polyhedron]] with a [[Set]] of [[Vertex|vertices]] $V$ with the [[Center of Mass]] at 0, the symmetry group is $G = \{A \in SO(3) | v \in V \iff Av \in V, \forall v \in \mathbb{R}^3\}$
- $G \leq SO(3)$ is a finite [[Subgroup]]
- $|G| = 2 \times$ number of [[Edge|edges]]
