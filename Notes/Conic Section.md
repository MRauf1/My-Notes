> [!info] Definition 1 (Determining Conic Section from Equation)[^2]
> Suppose the equation $Ax^2 + By^2 + Cx + Dy + F = 0$ is a non-degenerate conic section.
> 1) If just one variable is squared, it is a [[Parabola]].
> 2) If both variables are squared
> 	1) If $A = B$, it is a [[Circle]]
> 	2) If $A \neq B$, but $A, B$ have the same sign, it is an [[Ellipse]]
> 	3) If $A \neq B$ and $A, B$ have different signs, it is a [[Hyperbola]]
