# Definition

In [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] psychology, it is what life wants/asking of you.

It is something that you can only do with effort and difficulty, but it is something that enlarges you (rather than making you immediately happy). But even though it is difficulty, it is something that is currently within your capabilities.[^1]

It is different from destiny/[[Fate]].
