# [[Viktor Frankl]]'s Perspective[^1]
Frankl believes that love is the ultimate and highest goal a man can aspire to. Would imagine his wife and talk to her.
Love goes beyond the physical self. It finds its deepest meaning in the spiritual being, the inner self. Frankl kept going with love even though he didn't know whether his wife was dead or alive.
