# [[Eckhart Tolle]]'s Perspective[^1]
Humans cannot experience the past or the future. Can only experience the present. Therefore, according to Tolle, the ends never justify the means because the end is some imagined future. Do not live your life as a means to an end of some goal. Such life becomes miserable. Focus on the means, on the present, enjoy each moment.

Give more attention to the doing than the result you're trying to achieve. As Hindus say, don't worry about the fruit of action, only worry about the action itself. Fruit will come of its own accord. At this point, neither failure nor success will be able to affect you as you care about the process.
