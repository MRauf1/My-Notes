# Definition

[[Meditation]] focused on the acquisition of insight into the reality of the present and oneself as well as the permanent transformation of one's sensory and cognitive experience. It cultivates awareness and [[Mindfulness]].[^1]

It is done through focusing solely on the present moment and everything that happens within this moment. Each moment is unique and new.

# Effects

## Benefits

### [[Ego]]
Meditation helps separate the ego and the self and to see into one's true self. The ego is weakened by being observed and understood. The ego is the false self that is brought about from one's reactions and thoughts.

### [[Thought]]/Mental States
Whenever thoughts pop-up, we typically grasp them or push them away depending on what they are, which only strengthens and prolongs them. Meditation helps to see the thoughts for what they are unjudgmentally with a sense of detachment and accept them without identifying with them.

Don't fear the popping thoughts. They cannot hurt you. It's just memory of the past; it's just a fantasy of the future. It's nothing but fear.

There is a difference between being aware of a thought and thinking a thought. Former is more detached, while the latter sucks you into the thought chain.

### [[Perception]]
Humans block out 99% of all received sensory stimuli, and the rest are categorized as certain mental objects/concepts, which humans then react to in programmed habitual ways. Meditation helps to focus on the present perception and transform perception itself.

### Attachment
It helps to lessen and potentially get rid of attachments, be they positive or negative. All of them hold you back from experiencing the present fully.

### Acceptance
We cannot objectively observe a mental state without fully accepting it. This is especially true for unpleasant states of mind. Thus, meditation helps with acceptance.

### Loving Kindness
Foster positive feelings of universal loving-kindness toward all living beings, even your enemies. By bringing peace to your enemies, they are no longer your enemies, and you can live in peace.

Practicing loving-kindness makes you more compassionate and friendly towards others, and helps to purify your mind.
Need to practice loving-kindness within oneself first before being able to project it towards others.


# How to Vipassana Meditate

Sit in a still position and focus on a mental object, such as the breath. Focus not just on the physical aspect of the breath, but the very process of the perception of breath - feelings, thoughts, reactions. Don't control anything, simply let everything flow and observe it all.

## Breath
Breath is a process that doesn't require thought. It is a living process that is constantly changing - a miniature model of life itself. While it may seem simple, in reality it is a very complex and fascinating process. If you find it boring, then you're not observing it fully. Don't conceptualize/categorize it.

## Distractions (Pain, Boredom, Worry, Aversion to Meditation)
As these distractions pop up, if they cannot be dealt with immediately (such as changing posture to deal with pain), then make these the new objects of meditations for as long as they present. By applying [[Mindfulness]] to them, their power will diminish and they might eventually fade away. You may even find these distractions beautiful.

As such, there is no such thing as a distraction, since the "distraction" can just be turned into an object of meditation.
