# Review[^1]

Book by [[Tiago Forte]].

The first part honestly feels like mostly filler to me. Maybe it's because I already use Obsidian and have a system for taking notes. But even then, the first part could have been so much shorter.

The example stories about other people are too long, in my opinion. It's taking too long to get to the crux of the point too. It's been 3 pages since the beginning of the chapter, and the author still hasn't gotten to the main material.

There is some repetition throughout the book.

He presents some ideas in the book like PARA and CODE, but in my opinion, for research, I prefer Zettelkasten over these systems.

He also advises certain techniques that science shows to not be very effective, such as all kinds of highlighting, bolding, copying content first before phrasing in one's own words (and even this is only done for a few notes, not all of them), and so on. And overall, there isn't scientific evidence to back up some of his claims.
