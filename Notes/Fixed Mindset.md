# Definition

[[Mindset|Mindset]] with the belief that skills/attributes/relationships/other characteristics are fixed. 

Therefore, fixed mindset people expect everything to be perfect from the start, or else, it wasn't meant to be since things can't be improved. This creates a constant urgency to prove oneself by always looking good in front of others.

The burden of talent thus results in less enjoyment in something that was/could be enjoyable.

# Effects

## [[Learning]]
Learning is not enjoyed and not desired since abilities are fixed, so learning doesn't provide much benefit. It is viewed as a necessary pain in order to demonstrate one's abilities, which causes stress and anxiety towards the person since a failure would exhibit their flaws.

In terms of activities, they are only interested in things they do well in without effort, but immediately start losing interest when the activity starts becoming challenging and starts to require effort.

## Ability Estimation
People with the fixed mindset are bad at estimating their abilities.

## [[Life Development]]
Once little children become able of evaluating themselves, some become afraid of not being good enough, which then results in a switch to the fixed mindset.

## Teamwork
Two people with fixed mindset are likely to clash against each other.

## Leadership
Fixed mindset leaders may end up mistreating their employees/lowers due to the constant feeling of superiority.

## External Views

### In Relation to Others
People with the fixed mindset hide/lie about their deficiencies without working on them, and look for people who can boost their self-esteem instead of those who can challenge them to grow. 

The need for constant validation and the reliance on one's innate talents can, in worst cases, lead to feelings of superiority over others.

### Feedback
They are only interested when the feedback reflected on their ability.

### Comparisons to Others
Fixed mindset people like to compare themselves with those who are worse off. In positions of power, they make others worse than they are to feel superior. The victims most often are the competent ones who present a risk to the leader's greatness. This can result in the fixed mindset/same values being (unintentionally) forced onto the lower ranked people.

## Negative Modifiers

### [[Failure]]
The reason they shy away from effort is because their worst fear is putting in effort and still failing. Once this happens, they are failure and they have no excuses (before, they can say they haven't tried, which is why they failed).

This creates a paradoxical situation where these people must be flawless right away to avoid being a failure, but it is impossible to be flawless, and the only direction towards being flawless is through constant effort, which people with the fixed mindset avoid.

They are avert to challenges as they can show one's failures (action (failed) $\rightarrow$ identity (I'm a failure)), which people with fixed mindset struggle to cope with. Risk and effort are dangers that can reveal one's inadequacies. This means that a single test/failure can determine their entire future.

### [[Depression]]
These people have higher rates of depression, which in turn results in even less effort put towards everything.

### Stereotypes
Fixed mindset person is vulnerable to stereotypes/negative labels affecting them negatively.

### Delusions
People with fixed mindset may delude themselves into a situation where only validation comes to them, completely deluding themselves from the reality and truth that things may not be going in the right direction.

# Adopting Fixed Mindset

## In Others
Praising someone's talents can lead them to believe that talent is what matters, which leads to fixed mindset.
