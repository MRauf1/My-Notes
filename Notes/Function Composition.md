# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Function]] Composition)[^1]
> For functions $f: B \rightarrow C, g: A \rightarrow B$, their composition is $f \circ g = (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$, provided that $x$ is in the [[Domain]] of $g$ and $g(x)$ is in the domain of $f$. The new function is $f \circ g = h: A \rightarrow C$.

# Properties

## [[Associative Property]]

## [[Identity Property]]
