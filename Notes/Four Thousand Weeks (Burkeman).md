# Review[^1]

Book by [[Oliver Burkeman]] focusing on the finite amount of time that a human has to live and the lack of control a human has over their own life.

The more one tries to take control of time by completing things from their bucket list (as an example), the more things will pile up and the more encumbered one will become.

As such, humans must accept their finitude and lack of control and prioritize the things that truly matter to them. Choosing cannot be avoided. Acceptance is the way forward.
