# Review[^1]

Book by [[Oliver Burkeman]] focusing on the finite amount of time that a human has to live and the lack of control a human has over their own life.

Overall, it is a pretty good book. There is some repetition, especially towards the end, but I still feel like the book is relatively decent and worth reading for those in constant anxiety over their inability to control everything.

The more one tries to take control of time by completing things from their bucket list (as an example), the more things will pile up and the more encumbered one will become.

As such, humans must accept their finitude and lack of control and prioritize the things that truly matter to them. Choosing cannot be avoided. Acceptance is the way forward.

5 questions to keep asking yourself throughout life:
1) Where in your life or your work are you currently pursuing comfort, when what’s called for is a little discomfort?
2) Are you holding yourself to, and judging yourself by, standards of productivity or performance that are impossible to meet?
3) In what ways have you yet to accept the fact that you are who you are, not the person you think you ought to be?
4) In which areas of life are you still holding back until you feel like you know what you’re doing?
5) How would you spend your days differently if you didn’t care so much about seeing your actions reach fruition?
