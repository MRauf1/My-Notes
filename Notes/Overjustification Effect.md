# Definition

Some research suggests, that for a given task that was done for intrinsic value, [[Intrinsic Motivation]] is diminished when [[Extrinsic Motivation]] is given.[^1]

Other studies disagree and claim that extrinsic reinforcements (such as praise) may increase [[Intrinsic Motivation]].

Combining the two, when extrinsic reward is expected, [[Intrinsic Motivation]] tends to be reduced, but when it is not expected, [[Intrinsic Motivation]] remains high.
