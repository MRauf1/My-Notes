> [!info] Definition 1 (Peano [[Axiom|Axioms]])[^1]
> 1) $1 \in \mathbb{N}$
> 2) If $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then its successor $n + 1 \in \mathbb{N}$
> 3) $1$ is not the successor of any element of $\mathbb{N}$
> 4) If $n, m \in \mathbb{N}$ have the same successor, then $n = m$
> 5) [[Subset]] of $\mathbb{N}$ which contains $1$, and which contains $n + 1$ whenever it contains $n$, must equal $\mathbb{N}$

Axiom 5 is the basis of [[Proof by Induction]].
