# Definition

[[Set|Set]] of [[Ordered Pair|ordered pairs]], where the the first elements of the pair can be thought of as inputs, the second elements of the pair can be thought of as outputs, and the relation is the relationship between the inputs and outputs.[^1]

Not all relations are [[Function|functions]], but all functions are relations.
