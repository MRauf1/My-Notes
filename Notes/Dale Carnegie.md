# Biography

Born to poverty to the point he could not stay at school, but had to commute several miles on horseback every day. While staying home, still had to tend to the farm, the animals, and help out his family.

In school, read a lot of books and practiced his debating skills with the debate team. At first, he wasn't successful, but through hard work and persistence, eventually became quite remarkable.

After school, worked at various places. In particular, he would hitch a ride on the train, and at every town they would stop, he would get off and go into town to sell his company's products/services, and when the train would go, he'd run back and jump on the train as it started moving.

In the end, decided to make use of his debating/social skills by starting a course on communication. While it started small, it was effective and quickly grew in size.

His life demonstrates how far hard work, persistence, and passion can take a person even if a person is at a low point for most of their life.

He has quite the eloquent speech with a wide vocabulary, and it's a  pleasure to read his books even though the language may be a little dated.
