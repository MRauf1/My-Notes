# Review[^1]

Book by [[Cal Newport]] on slow productivity - productivity in which the focus is on fewer tasks, but these tasks are done with the highest quality/focus possible.

As per usual, the work is divided into 2 parts, where the 1st part is trying to persuade the reader that the following philosophy is good and beneficial (philosophy being slow productivity in this case) with the 2nd part being the application of philosophy. As usual, I believe that the first part can be condensed into a relatively short chapter. At least for me, I picked up this book with the hope of integrating slow productivity into my life. As such, I don't really need to be persuaded although a list of benefits can be welcome.

As he usually does, he uses lots of different examples to present his cases. However, some of the cases linger for longer than desired without adding much to the point.

The advice is also not universally applicable. For example, people with mental illnesses might struggle or have their mental health worsen through some of these suggestions, such as socially announcing plans and having the desire not to disappoint others as the motivator for pushing you forward. In particular, this book seems to be designed towards neurotypicals. Maybe even more specific than that.
