# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Subgroup)
> Subgroup is a [[Subset]] $H \subseteq G$, such that $H$, equipped with the restricted [[Operation]] of $G$ ($H \times H \rightarrow H$) is a [[Group]]
> Denoted as $H \leq G$
> Alternative way to check if a subset is a subgroup:
> 1) $H$ is non-empty (or $e \in H$)
> 2) $a, b \in H \implies ab \in H$ ($H$ is closed under multiplication)
> 3) $a \in H \implies a^{-1} \in H$ ($H$ is closed under inverses)
