# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Normal Subgroup)
> [[Subgroup]] $N \leq G$ such that $gNg^{-1} = N$ for all $g \in G$, where $gNg^{-1} := \{gng^{-1} | n \in N\}$
> Rather than equality, it is sufficient to show $gNg^{-1} \subseteq N$ for all $g \in G$ to show that $N$ is a normal subgroup.
> It is denotede as $N \trianglelefteq G$

# Properties

## [[Coset]]
- For $H \leq G$, the following are equivalent
	- $H$ is a normal subgroup
	- [[Left Coset|Left cosets]] are the same as [[Right Coset|right cosets]]
	- Every [[Left Coset]] is contained (is a [[Subset]] of) in a [[Right Coset]]
