# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Limit]] of [[Sequence]])[^1]
> A sequence $s_n$ of [[Real Number]] is said to converge to the real number (limit) $s$ if for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a number $N$ such that
> $$
> \begin{align}
> n > N \implies |s_n - s| < \epsilon
> \end{align}
> $$
> The limit of a sequence is denoted as $lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_n = s$ or $s_n \rightarrow s$. A sequence that does not converge is said to diverge.
> The limit for a sequence is unique.

Limit of a sequence is a value such that for all large $n$, the sequence is arbitrarily close to this value.
