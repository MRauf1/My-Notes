Limit of a [[Function]] $f(x)$ as $x \rightarrow a$ is $L$ from the left whenever $f(x)$ is arbitrarily close to $L$ for values of $x$ that are arbitrarily close to $a$ and less than $a$.

Limit of a [[Function]] $f(x)$ as $x \rightarrow a$ is $L$ from the right whenever $f(x)$ is arbitrarily close to $L$ for values of $x$ that are arbitrarily close to $a$ and greater than $a$.
