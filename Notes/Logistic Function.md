# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 (Logistic [[Function]])
> [[Function]] producing an S-shaped curve of the form
> $$
> \begin{align}
> f(x) = \frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(x - x_0)}}
> \end{align}
> $$
> where $L$ is the [[Supremum]] of the values of the functions (known as carrying capacity), $k$ is the logistic growth rate (steepness of the curve), and $x_0$ is the $x$ value of the function's midpoint.
> It has a [[Domain]] of $(-\infty, \infty)$ and [[Range]] of $(0, L)$.
