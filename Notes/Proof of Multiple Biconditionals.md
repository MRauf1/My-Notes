# Definition

> [!info] Definition 1 ([[Proof|Proof]] of Multiple [[Biconditional Statement|Biconditionals]])[^1]
> For [[Proposition|statement]] $P \iff Q \iff R$, instead of proving each biconditional separately, resulting in $2$ biconditionals and $4$ [[Conditional Statement|conditionals]], one can prove the cyclical conditionals ($3$ of them) instead
> 1) Prove $P \implies Q$
> 2) Prove $Q \implies R$
> 3) Prove $R \implies P$

This can extend to $n$ biconditionals.
