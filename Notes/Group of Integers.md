# Definition

[[Abelian Group]] of [[Set of Integers]] under [[Addition]], which is $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$.

# Properties

## Subgroups
- All [[Subgroup]] of $\mathbb{Z}$ are [[Cyclic Subgroup]] except for the trivial subgroup $<\{0\}> = \{0\}$
- Each non-trivial subgroup has [[Group Order]] of $\infty$
- Each subgroup is $\mathbb{Z}d$ for a unique $d \geq 0$
- Each non-trivial subgroup is [[Group Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\mathbb{Z}$
## Other
- Given $H \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$, $\tilde{H} := \{a \in \mathbb{Z} | [a]_n \in H\} = \cup_{S \in H} S \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, then $H \leq \mathbb{Z}_n \iff \tilde{H} \leq \mathbb{Z}$
