Any number (except $0$) [[Division|divided]] by itself is $1$. Any number divided by $1$ is itself. [^1]

#TODO

- For all x except 0, would saying forall x neq 0 be valid, or is that a bit confusing?
- Rename this to be consistent with division by -1 note. Instead of "one", write 1. Do the same for the other notes.
