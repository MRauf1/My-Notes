An [[Operation|operation]] $\times_2$ is an inverse of another operation $\times_1$ if $\times_2$ undoes $\times_1$.

[[Addition|Addition]] and [[Subtraction|subtraction]] are inverse operations. [^1] [[Multiplication|Multiplication]] and [[Division|division]] are inverse operations.[^2]

#TODO:

- If or iff?
- Didn't put in forall, since this doesn't hold true for all values (multiplication and division by 0). Add this in somewhere. More importantly, what's the exact requirement? Does it not have to hold for all values? Is it enough for some? That sounds a bit too broad though.
