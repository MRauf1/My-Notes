[[Proposition|Proposition]] that shows that two quantities are equal.[^1] The equality symbol is $=$.[^2] When equality is being tested, the symbol is $\overset{?}{=}$.[^3]

#TODO

- Elaborate on quantities (numbers + expressions)
- Math sentence doesn't sound good. Use relational statement instead. Can then link this to relational statement note. Although, maybe use just statement (or math statement) instead of relational statement? Look into proper definition and types of math statements. And would expression count as a math statement?
- Talk about the equal sign too. Maybe also express this as a function that takes in two expressions and returns true or false. Never mind, equations are technically not functions, since functions are sets, and equations are not sets.
