# Definition

The process of decomposing a [[Number|number]] into a [[Multiplication|product]] of [[Prime Number|primes]].[^1] For each natural number, this factorization is unique.

> > $2^2 \cdot 3$ is the prime factorization of $12$.

#TODO 

- Maybe mention how to do this, such as the factor tree method on page 172-173? Or the ladder method on page 175.
