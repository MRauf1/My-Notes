# Definition

A mental shortcut/behavior learned from experience that is done by the non-conscious part of the mind. It is more efficient than conscious action and is used to reduce cognitive load.[^1]

The more that the habits are properly handled, the more free your mind is to pursue other tasks of greater interest/importance.

Since habits are repeating behaviors, they are among the most crucial ones in reinforcing one's [[Personal Identity]]. Habits shape identity and identity shapes habits. Feedback loop.


# Steps

1) [[Cue]]/[[Law of Cue]]
2) [[Craving]]/[[Law of Craving]]
3) [[Response]]/[[Law of Response]]
4) [[Reward]]/[[Law of Reward]]

Without the first three, the behavior will not occur. Without the fourth, the behavior will not be repeated.

The first two are part of the Problem Phase, while the latter two are part of the Solution Phase. All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem.

# Strengthening Habits
The more you practice, the more the habit is strengthened and vice versa. Habits form based on frequency of the habit.

## Refining Habits
As habits become ingrained, we become blind to the feedback, which, according to some research, ends up with a slight performance decrease over time.

Even when a habit has been established, need to go into a mode of deliberate practice if you want to keep improving the habit. This improvement must be practiced repetitively until it transforms into an improved habit. Then, would need to repeat the process for each improvement. Must be able to reflect and review on the habit to be able to improve it. Make this process periodic and consistent.

# Habits Influencing Actions
Habits are among the main causes of your outcomes (both directly and indirectly). Even big changes are the result of constant small actions that you took before. Directly, researchers estimate that 40-50% of actions are done out of habit. The number is even more for the habits' indirect influence.

# Stacking/Grouping Habits
## Stacking
Stack habits sequentially so that when one ends, you begin another one. That way, only need the motivation for the first one, and the other ones will naturally follow.

## Grouping
Group related habits to incentivize starting other habits when one ends. In other words, group a habit with other habits that incentivize at least one of the 4 steps of habits (such as increasing the reward for the habit).

For example, group running and showering. Need only start running, and after running, will be more incentivized to shower even though initially, it wasn't motivational.

# Improvement Degree
Habits work like compound interest. It may take a while to get a habit up and running and to see the benefits, but once it's consistently done, the results will eventually compound into something big.

For example, improving by $1\%$ every day for a year would yield a $37.78x$ improvement.
