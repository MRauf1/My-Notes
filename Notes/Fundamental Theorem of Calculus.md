# Definition

> [!abstract] Theorem 1 (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1)[^1]
> If $f$ is [[Continuous Function]] on $[a, b]$, then the [[Function]] $g$ defined by $g(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt$ for $x \in [a, b]$ is [[Continuous Function]] on $[a, b]$ and [[Differentiable Function]] on $(a, b)$ and $g'(x) = f(x)$
> Alternatively, we can write it as $g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x)$

Function $g$ is the [[Antiderivative]] of $f$.

> [!abstract] Theorem 2 (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 2)
> If $f$ is [[Continuous Function]] on $[a, b]$ then $\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)$ where $F$ is any [[Antiderivative]] of $f$

[[Derivative]] and [[Integral]] are [[Inverse Function|Inverse operators]].
